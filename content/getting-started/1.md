## Ask Kubernetes to run NGINX

```console
$ kubectl create deployment first --image=nginx
deployment.apps/first created
```

## Look at what resources are running

```console
$ kubectl get all
NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/first   1/1     1            1           15h

NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/first-7f77d57ccc   1         1         1       15h

NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/first-7f77d57ccc-8gwkp   1/1     Running   0          15h
```

## Ask Kubernetes to forward a port to your new deployment

> Note: this process will run until you hit `ctrl-c` to break it.

```console
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/first 8080:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Handling connection for 8080
```

Access [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) from a web browser, or another terminal:

```console
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080

## Summary

What we just did was create a Kubernetes resource using the **[imperative](/glossary/#imperative)** command `kubectl create deployment`. This creates a **[Deployment](/glossary/#deployment)** resource which in turn creates a **[ReplicaSet](/glossary/#replicaset)** resource which in turn creates a **[Pod](/glossary/#pod)** resource.

> Note: see **Pod Resources** for an explanation of Pods and extended Pod resources.
