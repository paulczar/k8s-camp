title: 1. Run your first application
---

Above all else [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is a platform for running applications. It takes applications that are packaged into [Linux Containers](/glossary/#container) and runs them in a special executable environment called a [Pod](/glossary/#pod).

A simple application such as NGINX can be deployed to Kubernetes with a simple `kubectl` command. While this is not how you would deploy software into production, its a nice easy way to start getting familiar with Kubernetes.

## Ask Kubernetes to run NGINX

You can use the `kubectl create` command to create a [Deployment](/glossary/#deployment) which is a [Controller](/glossary/#controller) that wraps around a [Pod](/glossary/#pod) to provide additional functionality.

> Note: Kubernetes downloads images from an Image Registry, if a specific registry is not provided it will default to the public Docker Registry. Thus the image referenced below is being pulled from [https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).

```console
$ kubectl create deployment first --image=nginx
deployment.apps/first created
```

## Look at what resources are running

> Note there are actually three resources that were deployed as a result of this command. `kubectl create deployment` created the [Deployment](/glossary/#deployment), which created the [ReplicaSet](/glossary/#replicaset), which created the [Pod](/glossary/#pod) in which the application itself is running.

```console
$ kubectl get all
NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/first   1/1     1            1           15h

NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/first-7f77d57ccc   1         1         1       15h

NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/first-7f77d57ccc-8gwkp   1/1     Running   0          15h
```

## Ask Kubernetes to forward a port to your new deployment

The astute observer would notice that there's no indication of how to access your application in the above output. That's because in order to access a running application in Kubernetes you would usually create a [Service](/glossary/#service).

However you can also access an application by using the `kubectl port-forward` command which will forward a port from your localhost into the specified Resource.

> Note: this process will run until you hit `ctrl-c` to break it.

```console
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/first 8080:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Handling connection for 8080
```

Access [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) from a web browser, or another terminal:

```console
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080

## Summary

What we just did was create a Kubernetes resource using the **[imperative](/glossary/#imperative)** command `kubectl create deployment`. This creates a **[Deployment](/glossary/#deployment)** resource which in turn creates a **[ReplicaSet](/glossary/#replicaset)** resource which in turn creates a **[Pod](/glossary/#pod)** resource.
