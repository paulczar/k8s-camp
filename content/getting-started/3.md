title: 3. Accessing apps via Services
---

So far we've [installed KIND](/getting-started), [run our first app](/getting-started/1), and learned how to [scale that app](/getting-started/2). However still haven't made the application accessible.

## Do

We can make it accessible by creating a [Service](/glossary/#service) which we can do with the `kubectl expose` command like so:

```console
$ kubectl expose deployment first --type=LoadBalancer --port 80
service/first exposed
```

After a few moments we can check what resources are now running in Kubernetes with `kubectl get all`:

```console
$ kubectl get all
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/first-765d49ddcb-92vv9   1/1     Running   0          20h
pod/first-765d49ddcb-f6hb4   1/1     Running   0          20h
pod/first-765d49ddcb-gcgkn   1/1     Running   0          20h

NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/first        LoadBalancer   10.108.204.60   <pending>     80:31063/TCP   2m4s

NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/first   3/3     3            3           41h

NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/first-765d49ddcb   3         3         3       20h
```

You can see we now have a new [Service](/glossary/#service) resource of type `LoadBalancer`. On cloud providers that support Load Balancers this would have wired up a Load Balancer to provide access to your application. Minikube does not have a Load Balancer and instead provides makes your application available via `minikube service`.

```console
$ minikube service first --url
http://192.168.99.107:32183
```

> Note: if you omit the `--url` part of the command it will automatically open your preferred browser to the URL.

You can then use curl or a web browser to access that URL:

```console
$ curl -s `minikube service first --url` | head -n 4
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
```
