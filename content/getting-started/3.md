title: 3. Accessing apps via Services
---

So far we've [installed KIND](/getting-started), [run our first app](/getting-started/1), and learned how to [scale that app](/getting-started/2). However still haven't made the application accessible.

We can make it accessible by creating a [Service](/glossary/#service) which we can do with the `kubectl expose` command like so:

```console
$ kubectl expose deployment first --type=LoadBalancer --port 80
service/first exposed
```

After a few moments we can check what resources are now running in Kubernetes with `kubectl get all`:

```console
$ kubectl get all
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/first-765d49ddcb-92vv9   1/1     Running   0          20h
pod/first-765d49ddcb-f6hb4   1/1     Running   0          20h
pod/first-765d49ddcb-gcgkn   1/1     Running   0          20h

NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/first        LoadBalancer   10.108.204.60   <pending>     80:31063/TCP   2m4s

NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/first   3/3     3            3           41h

NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/first-765d49ddcb   3         3         3       20h
```

You can see we now have a new [Service](/glossary/#service) resource of type `LoadBalancer`. However it has `pending` for its external IP address. This is because the Service resource wants to actually configure a Load Balancer for the application, but KIND does not have a built in load balancer.

> Note: If you had run this on a cloud provider's Kubernetes system such as Google's GKE, it would have automatically wired up a Google Load Balancer.

It is at this moment that it dawned on the author that KIND does not in fact support exposing ports to outside the Kubernetes cluster in a consistent way across various operating systems and that he would need to rewrite the tutorial to use minikube.

Except its Saturday and that sounds too much like actual work.
