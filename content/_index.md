---

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is big and hard. Don't let that get in your way. This internet website is designed to teach [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) basics in short easy to follow lessons that you can complete in less time than a coffee break.

## Why?

[Docker Swarm](https://dockerswarm.rocks/) isn't the only thing that Rocks.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is [currently] the leading Container Orchestrator.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) started at Google, and if there's one thing we all know, its that if Google does it, everyone should do it ... right?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is practices like devops and SRE distilled down to a Infrastructure Platform.

## Why Not ?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is not for everyone. There are many reasons another tool or platform is more suitable for you. That's Ok. Here's some alternative platforms that do similar things:

* Mesos - DC/OS
* Docker Swarm
* A computer
