title: Running Kubernetes
---

If you want to run Kubernetes just for the sake of learning, you can follow our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide, then move on to our practical lessons.

If you want to run Kubernetes for real... Lets chat here.

You have a lot of problems to solve at your place of work, running Kubernetes will likely add more problems than it will solve.

We're not saying don't use Kubernetes, we're just saying you probably shouldn't run it yourselves.

Your favorite public cloud provider has a managed Kubernetes offering, use that.

Your favorite private cloud software has a managed Kubernetes offering, use that.

Failing all that if you do want to run your own Kubernetes, here's some resources that will help:
