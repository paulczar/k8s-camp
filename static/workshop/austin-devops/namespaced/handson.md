## You get your own namespace

- We have one big Kubernetes cluster

- Each person gets a private namespace (not shared with anyone else)

- They'll remain up for the duration of the workshop

- If you're in the Zoom call, you should have already received the link to the workshop.

## Why don't we run containers locally?

- Installing this stuff can be hard on some machines

  (32 bits CPU or OS... Laptops without administrator access... etc.)

- *"The whole team downloaded all these container images from the WiFi!
  <br/>... and it went great!"* (Literally no-one ever)

- All you need is a computer (or even a phone or tablet!), with:

  - an internet connection

  - a web browser
