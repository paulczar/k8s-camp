## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster

# Pre-requirements

- Kubernetes concepts

  (pods, deployments, services, labels, selectors)

- Hands-on experience working with containers

  (building images, running them; doesn't matter how exactly)

- Familiar with the UNIX command-line

  (navigating directories, editing files, using `kubectl`)

## Labs and exercises

- We are going to build and break multiple clusters

- Everyone will get their own private environment(s)

- You are invited to reproduce all the demos (but you don't have to)

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

.exercise[

- This is the stuff you're supposed to do!

- Go to http://container.training/ to view these slides

- Join the chat room: In person!

<!-- ```open http://container.training/``` -->

## Private environments

- Each person gets their own private set of VMs

- Each person should have a printed card with connection information

- We will connect to these VMs with SSH

  (if you don't have an SSH client, install one **now!**)

---

## Doing or re-doing this on your own?

- We are using basic cloud VMs with Ubuntu LTS

- Kubernetes [packages] or [binaries] have been installed

  (depending on what we want to accomplish in the lab)

- We disabled IP address checks

  - we want to route pod traffic directly between nodes

  - most cloud providers will treat pod IP addresses as invalid

  - ... and filter them out; so we disable that filter

[packages]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl

[binaries]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#server-binaries

# Kubernetes architecture

We can arbitrarily split Kubernetes in two parts:

- the *nodes*, a set of machines that run our containerized workloads;

- the *control plane*, a set of processes implementing the Kubernetes APIs.

Kubernetes also relies on underlying infrastructure:

- servers, network connectivity (obviously!),

- optional components like storage systems, load balancers ...

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Control plane location

The control plane can run:

- in containers, on the same nodes that run other application workloads

  (example: Minikube; 1 node runs everything)

- on a dedicated node

  (example: a cluster installed with kubeadm)

- on a dedicated set of nodes

  (example: Kubernetes The Hard Way; kops)

- outside of the cluster

  (example: most managed clusters like AKS, EKS, GKE)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

![Kubernetes architecture diagram: control plane and nodes](images/k8s-arch2.png)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What runs on a node

- Our containerized workloads

- A container engine like Docker, CRI-O, containerd...

  (in theory, the choice doesn't matter, as the engine is abstracted by Kubernetes)

- kubelet: an agent connecting the node to the cluster

  (it connects to the API server, registers the node, receives instructions)

- kube-proxy: a component used for internal cluster communication

  (note that this is *not* an overlay network or a CNI plugin!)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What's in the control plane

- Everything is stored in etcd

  (it's the only stateful component)

- Everyone communicates exclusively through the API server:

  - we (users) interact with the cluster through the API server

  - the nodes register and get their instructions through the API server

  - the other control plane components also register with the API server

- API server is the only component that reads/writes from/to etcd

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Communication protocols: API server

- The API server exposes a REST API

  (except for some calls, e.g. to attach interactively to a container)

- Almost all requests and responses are JSON following a strict format

- For performance, the requests and responses can also be done over protobuf

  (see this [design proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/api-machinery/protobuf.md) for details)

- In practice, protobuf is used for all internal communication

  (between control plane components, and with kubelet)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Communication protocols: on the nodes

The kubelet agent uses a number of special-purpose protocols and interfaces, including:

- CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

  - used for communication with the container engine
  - abstracts the differences between container engines
  - based on gRPC+protobuf

- [CNI (Container Network Interface)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md)

  - used for communication with network plugins
  - network plugins are implemented as executable programs invoked by kubelet
  - network plugins provide IPAM
  - network plugins set up network interfaces in pods

# The Kubernetes API

[
*The Kubernetes API server is a "dumb server" which offers storage, versioning, validation, update, and watch semantics on API resources.*
](
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/api-machinery/protobuf.md#proposal-and-motivation
)

([Clayton Coleman](https://twitter.com/smarterclayton), Kubernetes Architect and Maintainer)

What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## The Kubernetes API is declarative

- We cannot tell the API, "run a pod"

- We can tell the API, "here is the definition for pod X"

- The API server will store that definition (in etcd)

- *Controllers* will then wake up and create a pod matching the definition

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## The core features of the Kubernetes API

- We can create, read, update, and delete objects

- We can also *watch* objects

  (be notified when an object changes, or when an object of a given type is created)

- Objects are strongly typed

- Types are *validated* and *versioned*

- Storage and watch operations are provided by etcd

  (note: the [k3s](https://k3s.io/) project allows us to use sqlite instead of etcd)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Let's experiment a bit!

- For the exercises in this section, connect to the first node of the `test` cluster

.exercise[

- SSH to the first node of the test cluster

- Check that the cluster is operational:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- All nodes should be `Ready`

]

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Create

- Let's create a simple object

.exercise[

- Create a namespace with the following command:
  ```bash
    kubectl create -f- <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: hello
    EOF
  ```

]

This is equivalent to `kubectl create namespace hello`.

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Read

- Let's retrieve the object we just created

.exercise[

- Read back our object:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace hello -o yaml
  ```

]

We see a lot of data that wasn't here when we created the object.

Some data was automatically added to the object (like `spec.finalizers`).

Some data is dynamic (typically, the content of `status`.)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## API requests and responses

- Almost every Kubernetes API payload (requests and responses) has the same format:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: xxx
    kind: yyy
    metadata:
      name: zzz
      (more metadata fields here)
    (more fields here)
  ```

- The fields shown above are mandatory, except for some special cases

  (e.g.: in lists of resources, the list itself doesn't have a `metadata.name`)

- We show YAML for convenience, but the API uses JSON

  (with optional protobuf encoding)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## API versions

- The `apiVersion` field corresponds to an *API group*

- It can be either `v1` (aka "core" group or "legacy group"), or `group/versions`; e.g.:

  - `apps/v1`
  - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`
  - `extensions/v1beta1`

- It does not indicate which version of Kubernetes we're talking about

- It *indirectly* indicates the version of the `kind`

  (which fields exist, their format, which ones are mandatory...)

- A single resource type (`kind`) is rarely versioned alone

  (e.g.: the `batch` API group contains `jobs` and `cronjobs`)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Update

- Let's update our namespace object

- There are many ways to do that, including:

  - `kubectl apply` (and provide an updated YAML file)
  - `kubectl edit`
  - `kubectl patch`
  - many helpers, like `kubectl label`, or `kubectl set`

- In each case, `kubectl` will:

  - get the current definition of the object
  - compute changes
  - submit the changes (with `PATCH` requests)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Adding a label

- For demonstration purposes, let's add a label to the namespace

- The easiest way is to use `kubectl label`

.exercise[

- In one terminal, watch namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces --show-labels -w
  ```

- In the other, update our namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl label namespaces hello color=purple
  ```

]

We demonstrated *update* and *watch* semantics.

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What's special about *watch*?

- The API server itself doesn't do anything: it's just a fancy object store

- All the actual logic in Kubernetes is implemented with *controllers*

- A *controller* watches a set of resources, and takes action when they change

- Examples:

  - when a Pod object is created, it gets scheduled and started

  - when a Pod belonging to a ReplicaSet terminates, it gets replaced

  - when a Deployment object is updated, it can trigger a rolling update

# Other control plane components

- etcd ‚úîÔ∏è

- Controller manager

- Scheduler

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Controller manager

- This is a collection of loops watching all kinds of objects

- That's where the actual logic of Kubernetes lives

- When we create a Deployment (e.g. with `kubectl run web --image=nginx`),

  - we create a Deployment object

  - the Deployment controller notices it, and creates a ReplicaSet

  - the ReplicaSet controller notices the ReplicaSet, and creates a Pod

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Scheduler

- When a pod is created, it is in `Pending` state

- The scheduler (or rather: *a scheduler*) must bind it to a node

  - Kubernetes comes with an efficient scheduler with many features

  - if we have special requirements, we can add another scheduler
    <br/>
    (example: this [demo scheduler](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/scheduler) uses the cost of nodes, stored in node annotations)

- A pod might stay in `Pending` state for a long time:

  - if the cluster is full

  - if the pod has special constraints that can't be met

  - if the scheduler is not running (!)

# Building our own cluster

- Let's build our own cluster!

  *Perfection is attained not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. (Antoine de Saint-Exupery)*

- Our goal is to build a minimal cluster allowing us to:

  - create a Deployment (with `kubectl run` or `kubectl create deployment`)
  - expose it with a Service
  - connect to that service


- "Minimal" here means:

  - smaller number of components
  - smaller number of command-line flags
  - smaller number of configuration files

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Non-goals

- For now, we don't care about security

- For now, we don't care about scalability

- For now, we don't care about high availability

- All we care about is *simplicity*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Our environment

- We will use the machine indicated as `dmuc1`

  (this stands for "Dessine Moi Un Cluster" or "Draw Me A Sheep",
  <br/>in homage to Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince")

- This machine:

  - runs Ubuntu LTS

  - has Kubernetes, Docker, and etcd binaries installed

  - but nothing is running

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our environment

- Let's make sure we have everything we need first

.exercise[

- Log into the `dmuc1` machine

- Get root:
  ```bash
  sudo -i
  ```

- Check available versions:
  ```bash
  etcd -version
  kube-apiserver --version
  dockerd --version
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## The plan

1. Start API server

2. Interact with it (create Deployment and Service)

3. See what's broken

4. Fix it and go back to step 2 until it works!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Dealing with multiple processes

- We are going to start many processes

- Depending on what you're comfortable with, you can:

  - open multiple windows and multiple SSH connections

  - use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux

  - put processes in the background with `&`
    <br/>(warning: log output might get confusing to read!)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting API server

.exercise[

- Try to start the API server:
  ```bash
  kube-apiserver
  # It will fail with "--etcd-servers must be specified"
  ```

]

Since the API server stores everything in etcd,
it cannot start without it.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting etcd

.exercise[

- Try to start etcd:
  ```bash
  etcd
  ```

]

Success!

Note the last line of output:
```
serving insecure client requests on 127.0.0.1:2379, this is strongly discouraged!
```

*Sure, that's discouraged. But thanks for telling us the address!*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting API server (for real)

- Try again, passing the `--etcd-servers` argument

- That argument should be a comma-separated list of URLs

.exercise[

- Start API server:
  ```bash
  kube-apiserver --etcd-servers http://127.0.0.1:2379
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Interacting with API server

- Let's try a few "classic" commands

.exercise[

- List nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- List services:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```

]

We should get `No resources found.` and the `kubernetes` service, respectively.

Note: the API server automatically created the `kubernetes` service entry.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about `kubeconfig`?

- We didn't need to create a `kubeconfig` file

- By default, the API server is listening on `localhost:8080`

  (without requiring authentication)

- By default, `kubectl` connects to `localhost:8080`

  (without providing authentication)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Creating a Deployment

- Let's run a web server!

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment with NGINX:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

]

Success?

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our Deployment status

.exercise[

- Look at pods, deployments, etc.:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Our Deployment is in bad shape:
```
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/web   0/1     0            0           2m26s
```

And, there is no ReplicaSet, and no Pod.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- We stored the definition of our Deployment in etcd

  (through the API server)

- But there is no *controller* to do the rest of the work

- We need to start the *controller manager*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the controller manager

.exercise[

- Try to start the controller manager:
  ```bash
  kube-controller-manager
  ```

]

The final error message is:
```
invalid configuration: no configuration has been provided
```

But the logs include another useful piece of information:
```
Neither --kubeconfig nor --master was specified.
Using the inClusterConfig.  This might not work.
```

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Reminder: everyone talks to API server

- The controller manager needs to connect to the API server

- It *does not* have a convenient `localhost:8080` default

- We can pass the connection information in two ways:

  - `--master` and a host:port combination (easy)

  - `--kubeconfig` and a `kubeconfig` file

- For simplicity, we'll use the first option

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the controller manager (for real)

.exercise[

- Start the controller manager:
  ```bash
  kube-controller-manager --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our Deployment status

.exercise[

- Check all our resources again:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

We now have a ReplicaSet.

But we still don't have a Pod.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's going on?

In the controller manager logs, we should see something like this:
```
E0404 15:46:25.753376   22847 replica_set.go:450] Sync "default/web-5bc9bd5b8d"
failed with `No API token found for service account "default"`, retry after the
token is automatically created and added to the service account
```

- The service account `default` was automatically added to our Deployment

  (and to its pods)

- The service account `default` exists

- But it doesn't have an associated token

  (the token is a secret; creating it requires signature; therefore a CA)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Solving the missing token issue

There are many ways to solve that issue.

We are going to list a few (to get an idea of what's happening behind the scenes).

Of course, we don't need to perform *all* the solutions mentioned here.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 1: disable service accounts

- Restart the API server with
  `--disable-admission-plugins=ServiceAccount`

- The API server will no longer add a service account automatically

- Our pods will be created without a service account

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 2: do not mount the (missing) token

- Add `automountServiceAccountToken: false` to the Deployment spec

  *or*

- Add `automountServiceAccountToken: false` to the default ServiceAccount

- The ReplicaSet controller will no longer create pods referencing the (missing) token

.exercise[

- Programmatically change the `default` ServiceAccount:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch sa default -p "automountServiceAccountToken: false"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 3: set up service accounts properly

- This is the most complex option!

- Generate a key pair

- Pass the private key to the controller manager

  (to generate and sign tokens)

- Pass the public key to the API server

  (to verify these tokens)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Continuing without service account token

- Once we patch the default service account, the ReplicaSet can create a Pod

.exercise[

- Check that we now have a pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Note: we might have to wait a bit for the ReplicaSet controller to retry.

If we're impatient, we can restart the controller manager.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's next?

- Our pod exists, but it is in `Pending` state

- Remember, we don't have a node so far

  (`kubectl get nodes` shows an empty list)

- We need to:

  - start a container engine

  - start kubelet

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting a container engine

- We're going to use Docker (because it's the default option)

.exercise[

- Start the Docker Engine:
  ```bash
  dockerd
  ```

]

Success!

Feel free to check that it actually works with e.g.:
```bash
docker run alpine echo hello world
```

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- If we start kubelet without arguments, it *will* start

- But it will not join the cluster!

- It will start in *standalone* mode

- Just like with the controller manager, we need to tell kubelet where the API server is

- Alas, kubelet doesn't have a simple `--master` option

- We have to use `--kubeconfig`

- We need to write a `kubeconfig` file for kubelet

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Writing a kubeconfig file

- We can copy/paste a bunch of YAML

- Or we can generate the file with `kubectl`

.exercise[

- Create the file `kubeconfig.kubelet` with `kubectl`:
  ```bash
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            set-cluster localhost --server http://localhost:8080
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            set-context localhost --cluster localhost
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            use-context localhost
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## All Kubernetes clients can use `kubeconfig`

- The `kubeconfig.kubelet` file has the same format as e.g. `~/.kubeconfig`

- All Kubernetes clients can use a similar file

- The `kubectl config` commands can be used to manipulate these files

- This highlights that kubelet is a "normal" client of the API server

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Our `kubeconfig.kubelet` file

The file that we generated looks like the one below.

That one has been slightly simplified (removing extraneous fields), but it is still valid.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
current-context: localhost
contexts:
- name: localhost
  context:
    cluster: localhost
clusters:
- name: localhost
  cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
```

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

.exercise[

- Start kubelet with that `kubeconfig.kubelet` file:
  ```bash
  kubelet --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Looking at our 1-node cluster

- Let's check that our node registered correctly

.exercise[

- List the nodes in our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

Our node should show up.

Its name will be its hostname (it should be `dmuc1`).

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Are we there yet?

- Let's check if our pod is running

.exercise[

- List all resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

Our pod is still `Pending`. ü§î

--

Which is normal: it needs to be *scheduled*.

(i.e., something needs to decide which node it should go on.)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Scheduling our pod

- Why do we need a scheduling decision, since we have only one node?

- The node might be full, unavailable; the pod might have constraints ...

- The easiest way to schedule our pod is to start the scheduler

  (we could also schedule it manually)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the scheduler

- The scheduler also needs to know how to connect to the API server

- Just like for controller manager, we can use `--kubeconfig` or `--master`

.exercise[

- Start the scheduler:
  ```bash
  kube-scheduler --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

- Our pod should now start correctly

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking the status of our pod

- Our pod will go through a short `ContainerCreating` phase

- Then it will be `Running`

.exercise[

- Check pod status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Scheduling a pod manually

- We can schedule a pod in `Pending` state by creating a Binding, e.g.:
  ```bash
    kubectl create -f- <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Binding
    metadata:
      name: name-of-the-pod
    target:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      name: name-of-the-node
    EOF
  ```

- This is actually how the scheduler works!

- It watches pods, makes scheduling decisions, and creates Binding objects

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Connecting to our pod

- Let's check that our pod correctly runs NGINX

.exercise[

- Check our pod's IP address:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

- Send some HTTP request to the pod:
  ```bash
  curl `X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

We should see the `Welcome to nginx!` page.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Exposing our Deployment

- We can now create a Service associated with this Deployment

.exercise[

- Expose the Deployment's port 80:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
  ```

- Check the Service's ClusterIP, and try connecting:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service web
  curl http://`X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

--

This won't work. We need kube-proxy to enable internal communication.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting kube-proxy

- kube-proxy also needs to connect to the API server

- It can work with the `--master` flag

  (although that will be deprecated in the future)

.exercise[

- Start kube-proxy:
  ```bash
  kube-proxy --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Connecting to our Service

- Now that kube-proxy is running, we should be able to connect

.exercise[

- Check the Service's ClusterIP again, and retry connecting:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service web
  curl http://`X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## How kube-proxy works

- kube-proxy watches Service resources

- When a Service is created or updated, kube-proxy creates iptables rules

.exercise[

- Check out the `OUTPUT` chain in the `nat` table:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L OUTPUT
  ```

- Traffic is sent to `KUBE-SERVICES`; check that too:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SERVICES
  ```

]

For each Service, there is an entry in that chain.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Diving into iptables

- The last command showed a chain named `KUBE-SVC-...` corresponding to our service

.exercise[

- Check that `KUBE-SVC-...` chain:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L `KUBE-SVC-...`
  ```

- It should show a jump to a `KUBE-SEP-...` chains; check it out too:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L `KUBE-SEP-...`
  ```

]

This is a `DNAT` rule to rewrite the destination address of the connection to our pod.

This is how kube-proxy works!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## kube-router, IPVS

- With recent versions of Kubernetes, it is possible to tell kube-proxy to use IPVS

- IPVS is a more powerful load balancing framework

  (remember: iptables was primarily designed for firewalling, not load balancing!)

- It is also possible to replace kube-proxy with kube-router

- kube-router uses IPVS by default

- kube-router can also perform other functions

  (e.g., we can use it as a CNI plugin to provide pod connectivity)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about the `kubernetes` service?

- If we try to connect, it won't work

  (by default, it should be `10.0.0.1`)

- If we look at the Endpoints for this service, we will see one endpoint:

  `host-address:6443`

- By default, the API server expects to be running directly on the nodes

  (it could be as a bare process, or in a container/pod using the host network)

- ... And it expects to be listening on port 6443 with TLS

- Start the control plane on `kubenet1`

- Join the 3 nodes to the cluster

- Deploy and scale a simple web server

.exercise[

- Log into `kubenet1`

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Running the control plane

- We will use a Compose file to start the control plane components

.exercise[

- Clone the repository containing the workshop materials:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

- Go to the `compose/simple-k8s-control-plane` directory:
  ```bash
  cd container.training/compose/simple-k8s-control-plane
  ```

- Start the control plane:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Checking the control plane status

- Before moving on, verify that the control plane works

.exercise[

- Show control plane component statuses:
  ```bash
  kubectl get componentstatuses
  kubectl get cs
  ```

- Show the (empty) list of nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

## Differences from `dmuc`

- Our new control plane listens on `0.0.0.0` instead of the default `127.0.0.1`

- The ServiceAccount admission plugin is disabled

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Joining the nodes

- We need to generate a `kubeconfig` file for kubelet

- This time, we need to put the public IP address of `kubenet1`

  (instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)

.exercise[

- Generate the `kubeconfig` file:
  ```bash
    kubectl config set-cluster kubenet --server http://`X.X.X.X`:8080
    kubectl config set-context kubenet --cluster kubenet
    kubectl config use-context kubenet
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Distributing the `kubeconfig` file

- We need that `kubeconfig` file on the other nodes, too

.exercise[

- Copy `kubeconfig` to the other nodes:
  ```bash
    for N in 2 3; do
    	scp ~/kubeconfig kubenet$N:
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- Reminder: kubelet needs to run as root; don't forget `sudo`!

.exercise[

- Join the first node:
   ```bash
   sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
   ```

- Open more terminals and join the other nodes to the cluster:
  ```bash
  ssh kubenet2 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ssh kubenet3 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Checking cluster status

- We should now see all 3 nodes

- At first, their `STATUS` will be `NotReady`

- They will move to `Ready` state after approximately 10 seconds

.exercise[

- Check the list of nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Deploy a web server

- Let's create a Deployment and scale it

  (so that we have multiple pods on multiple nodes)

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment running NGINX:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

- Scale it:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Check our pods

- The pods will be scheduled on the nodes

- The nodes will pull the `nginx` image, and start the pods

- What are the IP addresses of our pods?

.exercise[

- Check the IP addresses of our pods
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

--

ü§î Something's not right ... Some pods have the same IP address!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- On a normal cluster, kubelet is configured to set up pod networking with CNI plugins

- This requires:

  - installing CNI plugins

  - writing CNI configuration files

  - running kubelet with `--network-plugin=cni`

- Without the `--network-plugin` flag, kubelet defaults to "no-op" networking

- It lets the container engine use a default network

  (in that case, we end up with the default Docker bridge)

- Our pods are running on independent, disconnected, host-local networks

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Using network plugins

- We need to set up a better network

- Before diving into CNI, we will use the `kubenet` plugin

- This plugin creates a `cbr0` bridge and connects the containers to that bridge

- This plugin allocates IP addresses from a range:

  - either specified to kubelet (e.g. with `--pod-cidr`)

  - or stored in the node's `spec.podCIDR` field

.footnote[See [here] for more details about this `kubenet` plugin.]

[here]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#kubenet

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What `kubenet` does and *does not* do

- It allocates IP addresses to pods *locally*

  (each node has its own local subnet)

- It connects the pods to a *local* bridge

  (pods on the same node can communicate together; not with other nodes)

- It doesn't set up routing or tunneling

  (we get pods on separated networks; we need to connect them somehow)

- It doesn't allocate subnets to nodes

  (this can be done manually, or by the controller manager) 

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Setting up routing or tunneling

- *On each node*, we will add routes to the other nodes' pod network

- Of course, this is not convenient or scalable!

- We will see better techniques to do this; but for now, hang on!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Allocating subnets to nodes

- There are multiple options:

  - passing the subnet to kubelet with the `--pod-cidr` flag

  - manually setting `spec.podCIDR` on each node

  - allocating node CIDRs automatically with the controller manager

- The last option would be implemented by adding these flags to controller manager:
  ```
  --allocate-node-cidrs=true --cluster-cidr=<cidr> 
  ```

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The pod CIDR field is not mandatory

- `kubenet` needs the pod CIDR, but other plugins don't need it

  (e.g. because they allocate addresses in multiple pools, or a single big one)

- The pod CIDR field may eventually be deprecated and replaced by an annotation

  (see [kubernetes/kubernetes#57130](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57130))

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Restarting kubelet wih pod CIDR

- We need to stop and restart all our kubelets

- We will add the `--network-plugin` and `--pod-cidr` flags

- We all have a "cluster number" (let's call that `C`) printed on your VM info card

- We will use pod CIDR `10.C.N.0/24` (where `N` is the node number: 1, 2, 3)

.exercise[

- Stop all the kubelets (Ctrl-C is fine)

- Restart them all, adding `--network-plugin=kubenet --pod-cidr 10.C.N.0/24`

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What happens to our pods?

- When we stop (or kill) kubelet, the containers keep running

- When kubelet starts again, it detects the containers

.exercise[

- Check that our pods are still here:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

ü§î But our pods still use local IP addresses!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Recreating the pods

- The IP address of a pod cannot change

- kubelet doesn't automatically kill/restart containers with "invalid" addresses
  <br/>
  (in fact, from kubelet's point of view, there is no such thing as an "invalid" address)

- We must delete our pods and recreate them

.exercise[

- Delete all the pods, and let the ReplicaSet recreate them:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pods --all
  ```

- Wait for the pods to be up again:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Adding kube-proxy

- Let's start kube-proxy to provide internal load balancing

- Then see if we can create a Service and use it to contact our pods

.exercise[

- Start kube-proxy:
  ```bash
  sudo kube-proxy --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ```

- Expose our Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Test internal load balancing

.exercise[

- Retrieve the ClusterIP address:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc web
  ```

- Send a few requests to the ClusterIP address (with `curl`)

]

--

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Why?

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Routing traffic

- Our pods have new, distinct IP addresses

- But they are on host-local, isolated networks

- If we try to ping a pod on a different node, it won't work

- kube-proxy merely rewrites the destination IP address

- But we need that IP address to be reachable in the first place

- How do we fix this?

  (hint: check the title of this slide!)

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Important warning

- The technique that we are about to use doesn't work everywhere

- It only works if:

  - all the nodes are directly connected to each other (at layer 2)

  - the underlying network allows the IP addresses of our pods

- If we are on physical machines connected by a switch: OK

- If we are on virtual machines in a public cloud: NOT OK

  - on AWS, we need to disable "source and destination checks" on our instances

  - on OpenStack, we need to disable "port security" on our network ports

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Routing basics

- We need to tell *each* node:

  "The subnet 10.C.N.0/24 is located on node N" (for all values of N)

- This is how we add a route on Linux:
  ```bash
  ip route add 10.C.N.0/24 via W.X.Y.Z
  ```

  (where `W.X.Y.Z` is the internal IP address of node N)

- We can see the internal IP addresses of our nodes with:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Firewalling

- By default, Docker prevents containers from using arbitrary IP addresses

  (by setting up iptables rules)

- We need to allow our containers to use our pod CIDR

- For simplicity, we will insert a blanket iptables rule allowing all traffic:

  `iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT`

- This has to be done on every node

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Setting up routing

.exercise[

- Create all the routes on all the nodes

- Insert the iptables rule allowing traffic

- Check that you can ping all the pods from one of the nodes

- Check that you can `curl` the ClusterIP of the Service successfully

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What's next?

- We did a lot of manual operations:

  - allocating subnets to nodes

  - adding command-line flags to kubelet

  - updating the routing tables on our nodes

- We want to automate all these steps

- We want something that works on all networks

# The Container Network Interface

- Allows us to decouple network configuration from Kubernetes

- Implemented by *plugins*

- Plugins are executables that will be invoked by kubelet

- Plugins are responsible for:

  - allocating IP addresses for containers

  - configuring the network for containers

- Plugins can be combined and chained when it makes sense

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Combining plugins

- Interface could be created by e.g. `vlan` or `bridge` plugin

- IP address could be allocated by e.g. `dhcp` or `host-local` plugin

- Interface parameters (MTU, sysctls) could be tweaked by the `tuning` plugin

The reference plugins are available [here].

Look in each plugin's directory for its documentation.

[here]: https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## How does kubelet know which plugins to use?

- The plugin (or list of plugins) is set in the CNI configuration

- The CNI configuration is a *single file* in `/etc/cni/net.d`

- If there are multiple files in that directory, the first one is used

  (in lexicographic order)

- That path can be changed with the `--cni-conf-dir` flag of kubelet

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## CNI configuration in practice

- When we set up the "pod network" (like Calico, Weave...) it ships a CNI configuration

  (and sometimes, custom CNI plugins)

- Very often, that configuration (and plugins) is installed automatically

  (by a DaemonSet featuring an initContainer with hostPath volumes)

- Examples:

  - Calico [CNI config](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/1372b56e3bfebe2b9c9cbf8105d6a14764f44159/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml#L25)
    and [volume](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/1372b56e3bfebe2b9c9cbf8105d6a14764f44159/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml#L219)

  - kube-router [CNI config](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/c2f893f64fd60cf6d2b6d3fee7191266c0fc0fe5/daemonset/generic-kuberouter.yaml#L10)
    and [volume](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/c2f893f64fd60cf6d2b6d3fee7191266c0fc0fe5/daemonset/generic-kuberouter.yaml#L73)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Conf vs conflist

- There are two slightly different configuration formats

- Basic configuration format:

  - holds configuration for a single plugin
  - typically has a `.conf` name suffix
  - has a `type` string field in the top-most structure
  - [examples](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#example-configurations)

- Configuration list format:

  - can hold configuration for multiple (chained) plugins
  - typically has a `.conflist` name suffix
  - has a `plugins` list field in the top-most structure
  - [examples](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#network-configuration-lists)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## How plugins are invoked

- Parameters are given through environment variables, including:

  - CNI_COMMAND: desired operation (ADD, DEL, CHECK, or VERSION)

  - CNI_CONTAINERID: container ID

  - CNI_NETNS: path to network namespace file

  - CNI_IFNAME: what the network interface should be named

- The network configuration must be provided to the plugin on stdin

  (this avoids race conditions that could happen by passing a file path)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## In practice: kube-router

- We are going to set up a new cluster

- For this new cluster, we will use kube-router

- kube-router will provide the "pod network"

  (connectivity with pods)

- kube-router will also provide internal service connectivity

  (replacing kube-proxy)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## How kube-router works

- Very simple architecture

- Does not introduce new CNI plugins

  (uses the `bridge` plugin, with `host-local` for IPAM)

- Pod traffic is routed between nodes

  (no tunnel, no new protocol)

- Internal service connectivity is implemented with IPVS

- Can provide pod network and/or internal service connectivity

- kube-router daemon runs on every node

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## What kube-router does

- Connect to the API server

- Obtain the local node's `podCIDR`

- Inject it into the CNI configuration file

  (we'll use `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conflist`)

- Obtain the addresses of all nodes

- Establish a *full mesh* BGP peering with the other nodes

- Exchange routes over BGP

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## What's BGP?

- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol used between internet routers

- It [scales](https://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/)
  pretty [well](https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/plota?file=%2fvar%2fdata%2fbgp%2fas2.0%2fbgp-active%2etxt&descr=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&ylabel=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&with=step)
  (it is used to announce the 700k CIDR prefixes of the internet)

- It is spoken by many hardware routers from many vendors

- It also has many software implementations (Quagga, Bird, FRR...)

- Experienced network folks generally know it (and appreciate it)

- It also used by Calico (another popular network system for Kubernetes)

- Using BGP allows us to interconnect our "pod network" with other systems

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## The plan

- We'll work in a new cluster (named `kuberouter`)

- We will run a simple control plane (like before)

- ... But this time, the controller manager will allocate `podCIDR` subnets

  (so that we don't have to manually assign subnets to individual nodes)

- We will create a DaemonSet for kube-router

- We will join nodes to the cluster

- The DaemonSet will automatically start a kube-router pod on each node

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Logging into the new cluster

.exercise[

- Log into node `kuberouter1`

- Clone the workshop repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

- Move to this directory:
  ```bash
  cd container.training/compose/kube-router-k8s-control-plane
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Our control plane

- We will use a Compose file to start the control plane

- It is similar to the one we used with the `kubenet` cluster

- The API server is started with `--allow-privileged`

  (because we will start kube-router in privileged pods)

- The controller manager is started with extra flags too:

  `--allocate-node-cidrs` and `--cluster-cidr`

- We need to edit the Compose file to set the Cluster CIDR

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting the control plane

- Our cluster CIDR will be `10.C.0.0/16`

  (where `C` is our cluster number)

.exercise[

- Edit the Compose file to set the Cluster CIDR:
  ```bash
  vim docker-compose.yaml
  ```

- Start the control plane:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## The kube-router DaemonSet

- In the same directory, there is a `kuberouter.yaml` file

- It contains the definition for a DaemonSet and a ConfigMap

- Before we load it, we also need to edit it

- We need to indicate the address of the API server

  (because kube-router needs to connect to it to retrieve node information)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Creating the DaemonSet

- The address of the API server will be `http://A.B.C.D:8080`

  (where `A.B.C.D` is the public address of `kuberouter1`, running the control plane)

.exercise[

- Edit the YAML file to set the API server address:
  ```bash
  vim kuberouter.yaml
  ```

- Create the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f kuberouter.yaml
  ```

]

Note: the DaemonSet won't create any pods (yet) since there are no nodes (yet).

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Generating the kubeconfig for kubelet

- This is similar to what we did for the `kubenet` cluster

.exercise[

- Generate the kubeconfig file (replacing `X.X.X.X` with the address of `kuberouter1`):
  ```bash
    kubectl config set-cluster cni --server http://`X.X.X.X`:8080
    kubectl config set-context cni --cluster cni
    kubectl config use-context cni
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Distributing kubeconfig

- We need to copy that kubeconfig file to the other nodes

.exercise[

- Copy `kubeconfig` to the other nodes:
  ```bash
    for N in 2 3; do
    	scp ~/kubeconfig kuberouter$N:
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- We don't need the `--pod-cidr` option anymore

  (the controller manager will allocate these automatically)

- We need to pass `--network-plugin=cni`

.exercise[

- Join the first node:
   ```bash
   sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
   ```

- Open more terminals and join the other nodes:
  ```bash
  ssh kuberouter2 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
  ssh kuberouter3 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]

## Setting up a test

- Let's create a Deployment and expose it with a Service

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment running a web server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=jpetazzo/httpenv
  ```

- Scale it so that it spans multiple nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5
  ```

- Expose it with a Service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=8888
  ```

]

- Get the ClusterIP address for the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc web
  ```

- Send a few requests there:
  ```bash
  curl `X.X.X.X`:8888
  ```

]

Note that if you send multiple requests, they are load-balanced in a round robin manner.

This shows that we are using IPVS (vs. iptables, which picked random endpoints).

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Troubleshooting

- What if we need to check that everything is working properly?

.exercise[

- Check the IP addresses of our pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

- Check our routing table:
  ```bash
  route -n
  ip route
  ```

]

We should see the local pod CIDR connected to `kube-bridge`, and the other nodes' pod CIDRs having individual routes, with each node being the gateway.

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## More troubleshooting

- We can also look at the output of the kube-router pods

  (with `kubectl logs`)

- kube-router also comes with a special shell that gives lots of useful info

  (we can access it with `kubectl exec`)

- But with the current setup of the cluster, these options may not work!

- Why?

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Trying `kubectl logs` / `kubectl exec`

.exercise[

- Try to show the logs of a kube-router pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system logs ds/kube-router
  ```

- Or try to exec into one of the kube-router pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system exec kube-router-xxxxx bash
  ```

]

These commands will give an error message that includes:
```
dial tcp: lookup kuberouterX on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host
```

What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Internal name resolution

- To execute these commands, the API server needs to connect to kubelet

- By default, it creates a connection using the kubelet's name

  (e.g. `http://kuberouter1:...`)

- This requires our nodes names to be in DNS

- We can change that by setting a flag on the API server:

  `--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP`

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Another way to check the logs

- We can also ask the logs directly to the container engine

- First, get the container ID, with `docker ps` or like this:
  ```bash
  CID=$(docker ps -q \
        --filter label=io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=kube-system \
        --filter label=io.kubernetes.container.name=kube-router)
  ```

- Then view the logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs $CID
  ```

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Other ways to distribute routing tables

- We don't need kube-router and BGP to distribute routes

- The list of nodes (and associated `podCIDR` subnets) is available through the API

- This shell snippet generates the commands to add all required routes on a node:

```bash
NODES=$(kubectl get nodes -o name | cut -d/ -f2)
for DESTNODE in $NODES; do
  if [ "$DESTNODE" != "$HOSTNAME" ]; then
    echo $(kubectl get node $DESTNODE -o go-template="
      route add -net {{.spec.podCIDR}} gw {{(index .status.addresses 0).address}}")
  fi
done
```

- This could be useful for embedded platforms with very limited resources

  (or lab environments for learning purposes)

# Interconnecting clusters

- We assigned different Cluster CIDRs to each cluster

- This allows us to connect our clusters together

- We will leverage kube-router BGP abilities for that

- We will *peer* each kube-router instance with a *route reflector*

- As a result, we will be able to ping each other's pods

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Disclaimers

- There are many methods to interconnect clusters

- Depending on your network implementation, you will use different methods

- The method shown here only works for nodes with direct layer 2 connection

- We will often need to use tunnels or other network techniques

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## The plan

- Someone will start the *route reflector*

  (typically, that will be the person presenting these slides!)

- We will update our kube-router configuration

- We will add a *peering* with the route reflector

  (instructing kube-router to connect to it and exchange route information)

- We should see the routes to other clusters on our nodes

  (in the output of e.g. `route -n` or `ip route show`)

- We should be able to ping pods of other nodes

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting the route reflector

- Only do this slide if you are doing this on your own

- There is a Compose file in the `compose/frr-route-reflector` directory

- Before continuing, make sure that you have the IP address of the route reflector

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Configuring kube-router

- This can be done in two ways:

  - with command-line flags to the `kube-router` process

  - with annotations to Node objects

- We will use the command-line flags

  (because it will automatically propagate to all nodes)

.footnote[Note: with Calico, this is achieved by creating a BGPPeer CRD.]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Updating kube-router configuration

- We need to pass two command-line flags to the kube-router process

.exercise[

- Edit the `kuberouter.yaml` file

- Add the following flags to the kube-router arguments:
  ```
  - "--peer-router-ips=`X.X.X.X`"
  - "--peer-router-asns=64512"
  ```
  (Replace `X.X.X.X` with the route reflector address)

- Update the DaemonSet definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f kuberouter.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Restarting kube-router

- The DaemonSet will not update the pods automatically

  (it is using the default `updateStrategy`, which is `OnDelete`)

- We will therefore delete the pods

  (they will be recreated with the updated definition)

.exercise[

- Delete all the kube-router pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-router
  ```

]

Note: the other `updateStrategy` for a DaemonSet is RollingUpdate.
<br/>
For critical services, we might want to precisely control the update process.

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Checking peering status

- We can see informative messages in the output of kube-router:
  ```
  time="2019-04-07T15:53:56Z" level=info msg="Peer Up"
  Key=X.X.X.X State=BGP_FSM_OPENCONFIRM Topic=Peer
  ```

- We should see the routes of the other clusters show up

- For debugging purposes, the reflector also exports a route to 1.0.0.2/32

- That route will show up like this:
  ```
  1.0.0.2     172.31.X.Y    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
  ```

- We should be able to ping the pods of other clusters!

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## If we wanted to do more ...

- kube-router can also export ClusterIP addresses

  (by adding the flag `--advertise-cluster-ip`)

- They are exported individually (as /32)

- This would allow us to easily access other clusters' services

  (without having to resolve the individual addresses of pods)

- Even better if it's combined with DNS integration

  (to facilitate name ‚Üí ClusterIP resolution)

# API server availability

- When we set up a node, we need the address of the API server:

  - for kubelet

  - for kube-proxy

  - sometimes for the pod network system (like kube-router)

- How do we ensure the availability of that endpoint?

  (what if the node running the API server goes down?)

.debug[[k8s/apilb.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/apilb.md)]
---

## Option 1: external load balancer

- Set up an external load balancer

- Point kubelet (and other components) to that load balancer

- Put the node(s) running the API server behind that load balancer

- Update the load balancer if/when an API server node needs to be replaced

- On cloud infrastructures, some mechanisms provide automation for this

  (e.g. on AWS, an Elastic Load Balancer + Auto Scaling Group)

- [Example in Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/08-bootstrapping-kubernetes-controllers.md#the-kubernetes-frontend-load-balancer)

.debug[[k8s/apilb.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/apilb.md)]
---

## Option 2: local load balancer

- Set up a load balancer (like NGINX, HAProxy...) on *each* node

- Configure that load balancer to send traffic to the API server node(s)

- Point kubelet (and other components) to `localhost`

- Update the load balancer configuration when API server nodes are updated

.debug[[k8s/apilb.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/apilb.md)]
---

## Updating the local load balancer config

- Distribute the updated configuration (push)

- Or regularly check for updates (pull)

- The latter requires an external, highly available store
 
  (it could be an object store, an HTTP server, or even DNS...)

- Updates can be facilitated by a DaemonSet

  (but remember that it can't be used when installing a new node!)

.debug[[k8s/apilb.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/apilb.md)]
---

## Option 3: DNS records

- Put all the API server nodes behind a round-robin DNS

- Point kubelet (and other components) to that name

- Update the records when needed

- Note: this option is not officially supported

  (but since kubelet supports reconnection anyway, it *should* work)

.debug[[k8s/apilb.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/apilb.md)]
---

## Option 4: ....................

- Many managed clusters expose a high-availability API endpoint

  (and you don't have to worry about it)

- You can also use HA mechanisms that you're familiar with

  (e.g. virtual IPs)

- Tunnels are also fine

  (e.g. [k3s](https://k3s.io/) uses a tunnel to allow each node to contact the API server)

# Installing a managed cluster

*"The easiest way to install Kubernetes is to get someone
else to do it for you."
<br/>
([J√©r√¥me Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo))*

- Let's see a few options to install managed clusters!

- This is not an exhaustive list

  (the goal is to show the actual steps to get started)

- All the options mentioned here require an account
with a cloud provider

- ... And a credit card

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## EKS (the hard way)

- [Read the doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html)

- Create service roles, VPCs, and a bunch of other oddities

- Try to figure out why it doesn't work

- Start over, following an [official AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-now-generally-available/)

- Try to find the missing Cloud Formation template

--

.footnote[(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª]

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## EKS (the easy way)

- Install `eksctl`

- Set the usual environment variables

  ([AWS_DEFAULT_REGION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#eks_region), AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl create cluster
  ```

- Wait 15-20 minutes (yes, it's sloooooooooooooooooow)

- Add cluster add-ons

  (by default, it doesn't come with metrics-server, logging, etc.)

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## EKS (cleanup)

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl delete cluster <clustername>
  ```

- If you need to find the name of the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl get clusters
  ```

.footnote[Note: the AWS documentation has been updated and now includes [eksctl instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).]

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## GKE (initial setup)

- Install `gcloud`

- Login:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth init
  ```

- Create a "project":
  ```bash
  gcloud projects create my-gke-project
  gcloud config set project my-gke-project
  ```

- Pick a [region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/)

  (example: `europe-west1`, `us-west1`, ...)

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## GKE (create cluster)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters create my-gke-cluster --region us-west1 --num-nodes=2
  ```

  (without `--num-nodes` you might exhaust your IP address quota!)

- The first time you try to create a cluster in a given project, you get an error

  - you need to enable the Kubernetes Engine API
  - the error message gives you a link
  - follow the link and enable the API (and billing)
    <br/>(it's just a couple of clicks and it's instantaneous)

- Wait a couple of minutes (yes, it's faaaaaaaaast)

- The cluster comes with many add-ons

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## GKE (cleanup)

- List clusters (if you forgot its name):
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters list
  ```

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters delete my-gke-cluster --region us-west1
  ```

- Delete the project (optional):
  ```bash
  gcloud projects delete my-gke-project
  ```

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]

## AKS (initial setup)

- Install the Azure CLI

- Login:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```

- Select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service&regions=all
)

- Create a "resource group":
  ```bash
  az group create --name my-aks-group --location westeurope
  ```

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## AKS (create cluster)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  az aks create --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

- Wait about 5-10 minutes

- Add credentials to `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
  az aks get-credentials --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

- The cluster has useful components pre-installed, such as the metrics server

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## AKS (cleanup)

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  az aks delete --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

- Delete the resource group:
  ```bash
  az group delete --resource-group my-aks-group
  ```

- Note: delete actions can take a while too!

  (5-10 minutes as well)

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## Digital Ocean (initial setup)

- Install `doctl`

- Generate API token (in web console)

- Set up the CLI authentication:
  ```bash
  doctl auth init
  ```
  (It will ask you for the API token)

- Check the list of regions and pick one:
  ```bash
  doctl compute region list
  ```
  (If you don't specify the region later, it will use `nyc1`)

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]
---

## Digital Ocean (create cluster)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  doctl kubernetes cluster create my-do-cluster [--region xxx1]
  ```

- Wait 5 minutes

- Update `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context do-xxx1-my-do-cluster
  ```

- The cluster comes with some components (like Cilium) but no metrics server

.debug[[k8s/setup-managed.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-managed.md)]

# Kubernetes distributions and installers

- There are [countless](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) distributions available

## kops

- Deploys Kubernetes using cloud infrastructure

- Leverages special cloud features when possible

  (e.g. Auto Scaling Groups ...)

.debug[[k8s/setup-selfhosted.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-selfhosted.md)]

## kubeadm

- Provisions Kubernetes nodes on top of existing machines

- `kubeadm init` to provision a single-node control plane

- `kubeadm join` to join a node to the cluster

- Supports HA control plane [with some extra steps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/) 

.debug[[k8s/setup-selfhosted.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-selfhosted.md)]

## RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine)

- Opinionated installer with low requirements

- Requires a set of machines with Docker + SSH access

- Supports highly available etcd and control plane

- The expert says: fast; maintenance can be tricky

.debug[[k8s/setup-selfhosted.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-selfhosted.md)]
---

## Terraform + kubeadm

- Sometimes it is necessary to build a custom solution

- Example use case: 

  - deploying Kubernetes on OpenStack

  - ... with highly available control plane

  - ... and Cloud Controller Manager integration

- Solution: Terraform + kubeadm (kubeadm driven by remote-exec)

  - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/enix/terraform-openstack-kubernetes)

  - [Blog post (in French)](https://enix.io/fr/blog/deployer-kubernetes-1-13-sur-openstack-grace-a-terraform/)

## And many more ...

- Docker Enterprise Edition

- [AKS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine)

- Pivotal Container Service (PKS)

- Tectonic by CoreOS

- etc.

.debug[[k8s/setup-selfhosted.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/setup-selfhosted.md)]
---

## Bottom line

- Each distribution / installer has pros and cons

- Before picking one, we should sort out our priorities:

  - cloud, on-premises, hybrid?

  - integration with existing network/storage architecture or equipment?

  - are we storing very sensitive data, like finance, health, military?

  - how many clusters are we deploying (and maintaining): 2, 10, 50?

  - which team will be responsible for deployment and maintenance?
    <br/>(do they need training?)

  - etc.

# Upgrading clusters

- It's *recommended* to run consistent versions across a cluster

  (mostly to have feature parity and latest security updates)

- It's not *mandatory*

  (otherwise, cluster upgrades would be a nightmare!)

- Components can be upgraded one at a time without problems

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we're running

- It's easy to check the version for the API server

.exercise[

- Log into node `test1`

- Check the version of kubectl and of the API server:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

]

- In a HA setup with multiple API servers, they can have different versions

- Running the command above multiple times can return different values

## Node versions

- It's also easy to check the version of kubelet

.exercise[

- Check node versions (includes kubelet, kernel, container engine):
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

]

- Different nodes can run different kubelet versions

- Different nodes can run different kernel versions

- Different nodes can run different container engines

- If the control plane is self-hosted (running in pods), we can check it

.exercise[

- Show image versions for all pods in `kube-system` namespace:
  ```bash
    kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods -o json \
            | jq -r '
              .items[]
              | [.spec.nodeName, .metadata.name]
                + 
                (.spec.containers[].image | split(":"))
              | @tsv
              ' \
            | column -t
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## What version are we running anyway?

- When I say, "I'm running Kubernetes 1.11", is that the version of:

  - kubectl

  - API server

  - kubelet

  - controller manager

  - something else?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Other versions that are important

- etcd

- kube-dns or CoreDNS

- CNI plugin(s)

- Network controller, network policy controller

- Container engine

- Linux kernel

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## General guidelines

- To update a component, use whatever was used to install it

- If it's a distro package, update that distro package

- If it's a container or pod, update that container or pod

- If you used configuration management, update with that

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Know where your binaries come from

- Sometimes, we need to upgrade *quickly*

  (when a vulnerability is announced and patched)

- If we are using an installer, we should:

  - make sure it's using upstream packages

  - or make sure that whatever packages it uses are current

  - make sure we can tell it to pin specific component versions

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to update a few cluster components

- We will change the kubelet version on one node

- We will change the version of the API server

- We will work with cluster `test` (nodes `test1`, `test2`, `test3`)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating kubelet

- These nodes have been installed using the official Kubernetes packages

- We can therefore use `apt` or `apt-get`

.exercise[

- Log into node `test3`

- View available versions for package `kubelet`:
  ```bash
  apt show kubelet -a | grep ^Version
  ```

- Upgrade kubelet:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install kubelet=1.15.3-00
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

.exercise[

- Log into node `test1`

- Check node versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Create a deployment and scale it to make sure that the node still works

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating the API server

- This cluster has been deployed with kubeadm

- The control plane runs in *static pods*

- These pods are started automatically by kubelet

  (even when kubelet can't contact the API server)

- They are defined in YAML files in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

  (this path is set by a kubelet command-line flag)

- kubelet automatically updates the pods when the files are changed

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Changing the API server version

- We will edit the YAML file to use a different image version

.exercise[

- Log into node `test1`

- Check API server version:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- Edit the API server pod manifest:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

- Look for the `image:` line, and update it to e.g. `v1.15.0`

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- The API server will be briefly unavailable while kubelet restarts it

.exercise[

- Check the API server version:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating the whole control plane

- As an example, we'll use kubeadm to upgrade the entire control plane

  (note: this is possible only because the cluster was installed with kubeadm)

.exercise[

- Check what will be upgraded:
  ```bash
  sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
  ```

]

Note 1: kubeadm thinks that our cluster is running 1.15.0.
<br/>It is confused by our manual upgrade of the API server!

Note 2: kubeadm itself is still version 1.14.6.
<br/>It doesn't know how to upgrade do 1.15.X.

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Upgrading kubeadm

- First things first: we need to upgrade kubeadm

.exercise[

- Upgrade kubeadm:
  ```
  sudo apt install kubeadm
  ```

- Check what kubeadm tells us:
  ```
  sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
  ```

]

Note: kubeadm still thinks that our cluster is running 1.15.0.
<br/>But at least it knows about version 1.15.X now.

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Upgrading the cluster with kubeadm

- Ideally, we should revert our `image:` change

  (so that kubeadm executes the right migration steps)

- Or we can try the upgrade anyway

.exercise[

- Perform the upgrade:
  ```bash
  sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.15.3
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating kubelets

- After updating the control plane, we need to update each kubelet

- This requires to run a special command on each node, to download the config

  (this config is generated by kubeadm)

.exercise[

- Download the configuration on each node, and upgrade kubelet:
  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3; do
      ssh test$N sudo kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.15.3
      ssh test$N sudo apt install kubelet=1.15.3-00
    done
  ```
]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- All our nodes should now be updated to version 1.15.3

.exercise[

- Check nodes versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Skipping versions

- This example worked because we went from 1.14 to 1.15

- If you are upgrading from e.g. 1.13, you will generally have to go through 1.14 first

- This means upgrading kubeadm to 1.14.X, then using it to upgrade the cluster

- Then upgrading kubeadm to 1.15.X, etc.

- **Make sure to read the release notes before upgrading!**

# Static pods

- Hosting the Kubernetes control plane on Kubernetes has advantages:

  - we can use Kubernetes' replication and scaling features for the control plane

  - we can leverage rolling updates to upgrade the control plane

- However, there is a catch:

  - deploying on Kubernetes requires the API to be available

  - the API won't be available until the control plane is deployed

- How can we get out of that chicken-and-egg problem?

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## A possible approach

- Since each component of the control plane can be replicated...

- We could set up the control plane outside of the cluster

- Then, once the cluster is fully operational, create replicas running on the cluster

- Finally, remove the replicas that are running outside of the cluster

*What could possibly go wrong?*

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Sawing off the branch you're sitting on

- What if anything goes wrong?

  (During the setup or at a later point)

- Worst case scenario, we might need to:

  - set up a new control plane (outside of the cluster)

  - restore a backup from the old control plane

  - move the new control plane to the cluster (again)

- This doesn't sound like a great experience

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods to the rescue

- Pods are started by kubelet (an agent running on every node)

- To know which pods it should run, the kubelet queries the API server

- The kubelet can also get a list of *static pods* from:

  - a directory containing one (or multiple) *manifests*, and/or

  - a URL (serving a *manifest*)

- These "manifests" are basically YAML definitions

  (As produced by `kubectl get pod my-little-pod -o yaml`)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods are dynamic

- Kubelet will periodically reload the manifests

- It will start/stop pods accordingly

  (i.e. it is not necessary to restart the kubelet after updating the manifests)

- When connected to the Kubernetes API, the kubelet will create *mirror pods*

- Mirror pods are copies of the static pods

  (so they can be seen with e.g. `kubectl get pods`)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping a cluster with static pods

- We can run control plane components with these static pods

- They can start without requiring access to the API server

- Once they are up and running, the API becomes available

- These pods are then visible through the API

  (We cannot upgrade them from the API, though)

*This is how kubeadm has initialized our clusters.*

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods vs normal pods

- The API only gives us read-only access to static pods

- We can `kubectl delete` a static pod...

  ...But the kubelet will re-mirror it immediately

- Static pods can be selected just like other pods

  (So they can receive service traffic)

- A service can select a mixture of static and other pods

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## From static pods to normal pods

- Once the control plane is up and running, it can be used to create normal pods

- We can then set up a copy of the control plane in normal pods

- Then the static pods can be removed

- The scheduler and the controller manager use leader election

  (Only one is active at a time; removing an instance is seamless)

- Each instance of the API server adds itself to the `kubernetes` service

- Etcd will typically require more work!

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## From normal pods back to static pods

- Alright, but what if the control plane is down and we need to fix it?

- We restart it using static pods!

- This can be done automatically with the [Pod Checkpointer]

- The Pod Checkpointer automatically generates manifests of running pods

- The manifests are used to restart these pods if API contact is lost

  (More details in the [Pod Checkpointer] documentation page)

- This technique is used by [bootkube]

[Pod Checkpointer]: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube/blob/master/cmd/checkpoint/README.md
[bootkube]: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Where should the control plane run?

*Is it better to run the control plane in static pods, or normal pods?*

- If I'm a *user* of the cluster: I don't care, it makes no difference to me

- What if I'm an *admin*, i.e. the person who installs, upgrades, repairs... the cluster?

- If I'm using a managed Kubernetes cluster (AKS, EKS, GKE...) it's not my problem

  (I'm not the one setting up and managing the control plane)

- If I already picked a tool (kubeadm, kops...) to set up my cluster, the tool decides for me

- What if I haven't picked a tool yet, or if I'm installing from scratch?

  - static pods = easier to set up, easier to troubleshoot, less risk of outage

  - normal pods = easier to upgrade, easier to move (if nodes need to be shut down)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods in action

- On our clusters, the `staticPodPath` is `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

.exercise[

- Have a look at this directory:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

]

We should see YAML files corresponding to the pods of the control plane.

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

class: static-pods-exercise

## Running a static pod

- We are going to add a pod manifest to the directory, and kubelet will run it

.exercise[

- Copy a manifest to the directory:
  ```bash
  sudo cp ~/container.training/k8s/just-a-pod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

- Check that it's running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

The output should include a pod named `hello-node1`.

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

class: static-pods-exercise

## Remarks

In the manifest, the pod was named `hello`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
Kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello
    image: nginx
```

The `-node1` suffix was added automatically by kubelet.

If we delete the pod (with `kubectl delete`), it will be recreated immediately.

To delete the pod, we need to delete (or move) the manifest file.

# Backing up clusters

- Backups can have multiple purposes:

  - disaster recovery (servers or storage are destroyed or unreachable)

  - error recovery (human or process has altered or corrupted data)

  - cloning environments (for testing, validation...)

- Let's see the strategies and tools available with Kubernetes!

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Important

- Kubernetes helps us with disaster recovery

  (it gives us replication primitives)

- Kubernetes helps us clone / replicate environments

  (all resources can be described with manifests)

- Kubernetes *does not* help us with error recovery

- We still need to back up/snapshot our data:

  - with database backups (mysqldump, pgdump, etc.)

  - and/or snapshots at the storage layer

  - and/or traditional full disk backups

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## In a perfect world ...

- The deployment of our Kubernetes clusters is automated

  (recreating a cluster takes less than a minute of human time)

- All the resources (Deployments, Services...) on our clusters are under version control

  (never use `kubectl run`; always apply YAML files coming from a repository)

- Stateful components are either:

  - stored on systems with regular snapshots

  - backed up regularly to an external, durable storage

  - outside of Kubernetes

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Kubernetes cluster deployment

- If our deployment system isn't fully automated, it should at least be documented

- Litmus test: how long does it take to deploy a cluster...

  - for a senior engineer?

  - for a new hire?

- Does it require external intervention?

  (e.g. provisioning servers, signing TLS certs...)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Plan B

- Full machine backups of the control plane can help

- If the control plane is in pods (or containers), pay attention to storage drivers

  (if the backup mechanism is not container-aware, the backups can take way more resources than they should, or even be unusable!)

- If the previous sentence worries you:

  **automate the deployment of your clusters!**

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Managing our Kubernetes resources

- Ideal scenario:

  - never create a resource directly on a cluster

  - push to a code repository

  - a special branch (`production` or even `master`) gets automatically deployed

- Some folks call this "GitOps"

  (it's the logical evolution of configuration management and infrastructure as code)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps in theory

- What do we keep in version control?

- For very simple scenarios: source code, Dockerfiles, scripts

- For real applications: add resources (as YAML files)

- For applications deployed multiple times: Helm, Kustomize...

  (staging and production count as "multiple times")

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps tooling

- Various tools exist (Weave Flux, GitKube...)

- These tools are still very young

- You still need to write YAML for all your resources

- There is no tool to:

  - list *all* resources in a namespace

  - get resource YAML in a canonical form

  - diff YAML descriptions with current state

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps in practice

- Start describing your resources with YAML

- Leverage a tool like Kustomize or Helm

- Make sure that you can easily deploy to a new namespace

  (or even better: to a new cluster)

- When tooling matures, you will be ready

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Plan B

- What if we can't describe everything with YAML?

- What if we manually create resources and forget to commit them to source control?

- What about global resources, that don't live in a namespace?

- How can we be sure that we saved *everything*?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Backing up etcd

- All objects are saved in etcd

- etcd data should be relatively small

  (and therefore, quick and easy to back up)

- Two options to back up etcd:

  - snapshot the data directory

  - use `etcdctl snapshot`

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Making an etcd snapshot

- The basic command is simple:
  ```bash
  etcdctl snapshot save <filename>
  ```

- But we also need to specify:

  - an environment variable to specify that we want etcdctl v3

  - the address of the server to back up

  - the path to the key, certificate, and CA certificate
    <br/>(if our etcd uses TLS certificates)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Snapshotting etcd on kubeadm

- The following command will work on clusters deployed with kubeadm

  (and maybe others)

- It should be executed on a master node

```bash
docker run --rm --net host -v $PWD:/vol \
    -v /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd:ro \
    -e ETCDCTL_API=3 k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10 \
    etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
            --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
            --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt \
            --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key \
            snapshot save /vol/snapshot
```

- It will create a file named `snapshot` in the current directory

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## How can we remember all these flags?

- Look at the static pod manifest for etcd

  (in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`)

- The healthcheck probe is calling `etcdctl` with all the right flags 
  üòâüëç‚úåÔ∏è

- Exercise: write the YAML for a batch job to perform the backup

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Restoring an etcd snapshot

- ~~Execute exactly the same command, but replacing `save` with `restore`~~

  (Believe it or not, doing that will *not* do anything useful!)

- The `restore` command does *not* load a snapshot into a running etcd server

- The `restore` command creates a new data directory from the snapshot

  (it's an offline operation; it doesn't interact with an etcd server)

- It will create a new data directory in a temporary container

  (leaving the running etcd node untouched)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## When using kubeadm

1. Create a new data directory from the snapshot:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
   docker run --rm -v /var/lib:/var/lib -v $PWD:/vol \
          -e ETCDCTL_API=3 k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10 \
          etcdctl snapshot restore /vol/snapshot --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
   ```

2. Provision the control plane, using that data directory:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init \
        --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--var-lib-etcd
   ```

3. Rejoin the other nodes

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## The fine print

- This only saves etcd state

- It **does not** save persistent volumes and local node data

- Some critical components (like the pod network) might need to be reset

- As a result, our pods might have to be recreated, too

- If we have proper liveness checks, this should happen automatically

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## More information about etcd backups

- [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#built-in-snapshot) about etcd backups

- [etcd documentation](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/recovery.html#snapshotting-the-keyspace) about snapshots and restore

- [A good blog post by elastisys](https://elastisys.com/2018/12/10/backup-kubernetes-how-and-why/) explaining how to restore a snapshot

- [Another good blog post by consol labs](https://labs.consol.de/kubernetes/2018/05/25/kubeadm-backup.html) on the same topic

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Don't forget ...

- Also back up the TLS information

  (at the very least: CA key and cert; API server key and cert)

- With clusters provisioned by kubeadm, this is in `/etc/kubernetes/pki`

- If you don't:

  - you will still be able to restore etcd state and bring everything back up

  - you will need to redistribute user certificates

.warning[**TLS information is highly sensitive! 
<br/>Anyone who has it has full access to your cluster!**]

## Stateful services

- It's totally fine to keep your production databases outside of Kubernetes

  *Especially if you have only one database server!*

- Feel free to put development and staging databases on Kubernetes

  (as long as they don't hold important data)

- Using Kubernetes for stateful services makes sense if you have *many*

  (because then you can leverage Kubernetes automation)

## Snapshotting persistent volumes

- Option 1: snapshot volumes out of band

  (with the API/CLI/GUI of our SAN/cloud/...)

- Option 2: storage system integration

  (e.g. [Portworx](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/) can [create snapshots through annotations](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/snaps-annotations/#taking-periodic-snapshots-on-a-running-pod))

- Option 3: [snapshots through Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/09/introducing-volume-snapshot-alpha-for-kubernetes/)

  (now in alpha for a few storage providers: GCE, OpenSDS, Ceph, Portworx)

# The Cloud Controller Manager

- Kubernetes has many features that are cloud-specific

  (e.g. providing cloud load balancers when a Service of type LoadBalancer is created)

- These features were initially implemented in API server and controller manager

- Since Kubernetes 1.6, these features are available through a separate process:

  the *Cloud Controller Manager*

- The CCM is optional, but if we run in a cloud, we probably want it!

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## Cloud Controller Manager duties

- Creating and updating cloud load balancers

- Configuring routing tables in the cloud network (specific to GCE)

- Updating node labels to indicate region, zone, instance type...

- Obtain node name, internal and external addresses from cloud metadata service

- Deleting nodes from Kubernetes when they're deleted in the cloud

- Managing *some* volumes (e.g. ELBs, AzureDisks...)

  (Eventually, volumes will be managed by the Container Storage Interface)

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## In-tree vs. out-of-tree

- A number of cloud providers are supported "in-tree"

  (in the main kubernetes/kubernetes repository on GitHub)

- More cloud providers are supported "out-of-tree"

  (with code in different repositories)

- There is an [ongoing effort](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/cloudprovider) to move everything to out-of-tree providers

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## In-tree providers

The following providers are actively maintained:

- Amazon Web Services
- Azure
- Google Compute Engine
- IBM Cloud
- OpenStack
- VMware vSphere

These ones are less actively maintained:

- Apache CloudStack
- oVirt
- VMware Photon

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## Out-of-tree providers

The list includes the following providers:

- DigitalOcean

- keepalived (not exactly a cloud; provides VIPs for load balancers)

- Linode

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

(And possibly others; there is no central registry for these.)

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## Audience questions

- What kind of clouds are you using/planning to use?

- What kind of details would you like to see in this section?

- Would you appreciate details on clouds that you don't / won't use?

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## Cloud Controller Manager in practice

- Write a configuration file

  (typically `/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf`)

- Run the CCM process

  (on self-hosted clusters, this can be a DaemonSet selecting the control plane nodes)

- Start kubelet with `--cloud-provider=external`

- When using managed clusters, this is done automatically

- There is very little documentation on writing the configuration file

  (except for OpenStack)

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping challenges

- When a node joins the cluster, it needs to obtain a signed TLS certificate

- That certificate must contain the node's addresses

- These addresses are provided by the Cloud Controller Manager

  (at least the external address)

- To get these addresses, the node needs to communicate with the control plane

- ...Which means joining the cluster

(The problem didn't occur when cloud-specific code was running in kubelet: kubelet could obtain the required information directly from the cloud provider's metadata service.)

.debug[[k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cloud-controller-manager.md)]
---

## More information about CCM

- CCM configuration and operation is highly specific to each cloud provider

  (which is why this section remains very generic)

- The Kubernetes documentation has *some* information:

  - [architecture and diagrams](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/)

  - [configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/) (mainly for OpenStack)

  - [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/)

# Healthchecks

- Kubernetes provides two kinds of healthchecks: liveness and readiness

- Healthchecks are *probes* that apply to *containers* (not to pods)

- Each container can have two (optional) probes:

  - liveness = is this container dead or alive?

  - readiness = is this container ready to serve traffic?

- Different probes are available (HTTP, TCP, program execution)

- Let's see the difference and how to use them!

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Liveness probe

- Indicates if the container is dead or alive

- A dead container cannot come back to life

- If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed

  (to make really sure that it's really dead; no zombies or undeads!)

- What happens next depends on the pod's `restartPolicy`:

  - `Never`: the container is not restarted

  - `OnFailure` or `Always`: the container is restarted

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a liveness probe

- To indicate failures that can't be recovered

  - deadlocks (causing all requests to time out)

  - internal corruption (causing all requests to error)

- If the liveness probe fails *N* consecutive times, the container is killed

- *N* is the `failureThreshold` (3 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Readiness probe

- Indicates if the container is ready to serve traffic

- If a container becomes "unready" (let's say busy!) it might be ready again soon

- If the readiness probe fails:

  - the container is *not* killed

  - if the pod is a member of a service, it is temporarily removed

  - it is re-added as soon as the readiness probe passes again

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a readiness probe

- To indicate temporary failures

  - the application can only service *N* parallel connections

  - the runtime is busy doing garbage collection or initial data load

- The container is marked as "not ready" after `failureThreshold` failed attempts

  (3 by default)

- It is marked again as "ready" after `successThreshold` successful attempts

  (1 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Different types of probes

- HTTP request

  - specify URL of the request (and optional headers)

  - any status code between 200 and 399 indicates success

- TCP connection

  - the probe succeeds if the TCP port is open

- arbitrary exec

  - a command is executed in the container

  - exit status of zero indicates success

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Benefits of using probes

- Rolling updates proceed when containers are *actually ready*

  (as opposed to merely started)

- Containers in a broken state get killed and restarted

  (instead of serving errors or timeouts)

- Overloaded backends get removed from load balancer rotation

  (thus improving response times across the board)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: HTTP probe

Here is a pod template for the `rng` web service of the DockerCoins app:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rng-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: rng
    image: dockercoins/rng:v0.1
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 1
```

If the backend serves an error, or takes longer than 1s, 3 times in a row, it gets killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: exec probe

Here is a pod template for a Redis server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command: ["redis-cli", "ping"]
```

If the Redis process becomes unresponsive, it will be killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Details about liveness and readiness probes

- Probes are executed at intervals of `periodSeconds` (default: 10)

- The timeout for a probe is set with `timeoutSeconds` (default: 1)

- A probe is considered successful after `successThreshold` successes (default: 1)

- A probe is considered failing after `failureThreshold` failures (default: 3)

- If a probe is not defined, it's as if there was an "always successful" probe

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---
## Questions to ask before adding healthchecks

- Do we want liveness, readiness, both?

  (sometimes, we can use the same check, but with different failure thresholds)

- Do we have existing HTTP endpoints that we can use?

- Do we need to add new endpoints, or perhaps use something else?

- Are our healthchecks likely to use resources and/or slow down the app?

- Do they depend on additional services?

  (this can be particularly tricky, see next slide)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Healthchecks and dependencies

- A good healthcheck should always indicate the health of the service itself

- It should not be affected by the state of the service's dependencies

- Example: a web server requiring a database connection to operate

  (make sure that the healthcheck can report "OK" even if the database is down;
  <br/>
  because it won't help us to restart the web server if the issue is with the DB!)

- Example: a microservice calling other microservices

- Example: a worker process

  (these will generally require minor code changes to report health)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Adding healthchecks to an app

- Let's add healthchecks to DockerCoins!

- We will examine the questions of the previous slide

- Then we will review each component individually to add healthchecks

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Liveness, readiness, or both?

- To answer that question, we need to see the app run for a while

- Do we get temporary, recoverable glitches?

  ‚Üí then use readiness

- Or do we get hard lock-ups requiring a restart?

  ‚Üí then use liveness

- In the case of DockerCoins, we don't know yet!

- Let's pick liveness

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Do we have HTTP endpoints that we can use?

- Each of the 3 web services (hasher, rng, webui) has a trivial route on `/`

- These routes:

  - don't seem to perform anything complex or expensive

  - don't seem to call other services

- Perfect!

  (See next slides for individual details)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

- [hasher.rb](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/hasher.rb)
  ```ruby
    get '/' do
      "HASHER running on #{Socket.gethostname}\n"
    end
  ```

- [rng.py](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/rng.py)
  ```python
    @app.route("/")
    def index():
      return "RNG running on {}\n".format(hostname)
  ```

- [webui.js](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/webui/webui.js)
  ```javascript
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.redirect('/index.html');
    });
  ```

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Running DockerCoins

- We will run DockerCoins in a new, separate namespace

- We will use a set of YAML manifests and pre-built images

- We will add our new liveness probe to the YAML of the `rng` DaemonSet

- Then, we will deploy the application

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Creating a new namespace

- This will make sure that we don't collide / conflict with previous exercises

.exercise[

- Create the yellow namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace yellow
  ```

- Switch to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns yellow
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Retrieving DockerCoins manifests

- All the manifests that we need are on a convenient repository:

  https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins

.exercise[

- Clone that repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

- Change directory to the repository:
  ```bash
  cd kubercoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## A simple HTTP liveness probe

This is what our liveness probe should look like:

```yaml
containers:
- name: ...
image: ...
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 5
```

This will give 30 seconds to the service to start. (Way more than necessary!)
<br/>
It will run the probe every 5 seconds.
<br/>
It will use the default timeout (1 second).
<br/>
It will use the default failure threshold (3 failed attempts = dead).
<br/>
It will use the default success threshold (1 successful attempt = alive).

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Adding the liveness probe

- Let's add the liveness probe, then deploy DockerCoins

.exercise[

- Edit `rng-daemonset.yaml` and add the liveness probe
  ```bash
  vim rng-daemonset.yaml
  ```

- Load the YAML for all the resources of DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Testing the liveness probe

- The rng service needs 100ms to process a request

  (because it is single-threaded and sleeps 0.1s in each request)

- The probe timeout is set to 1 second

- If we send more than 10 requests per second per backend, it will break

- Let's generate traffic and see what happens!

.exercise[

- Get the ClusterIP address of the rng service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc rng
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Monitoring the rng service

- Each command below will show us what's happening on a different level

.exercise[

- In one window, monitor cluster events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events -w
  ```

- In another window, monitor the response time of rng:
  ```bash
  httping `<ClusterIP>`
  ```

- In another window, monitor pods status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Generating traffic

- Let's use `ab` to send concurrent requests to rng

.exercise[

- In yet another window, generate traffic:
  ```bash
  ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://`<ClusterIP>`/1
  ```

- Experiment with higher values of `-c` and see what happens

]

- The `-c` parameter indicates the number of concurrent requests

- The final `/1` is important to generate actual traffic

  (otherwise we would use the ping endpoint, which doesn't sleep 0.1s per request)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Discussion

- Above a given threshold, the liveness probe starts failing

  (about 10 concurrent requests per backend should be plenty enough)

- When the liveness probe fails 3 times in a row, the container is restarted

- During the restart, there is *less* capacity available

- ... Meaning that the other backends are likely to timeout as well

- ... Eventually causing all backends to be restarted

- ... And each fresh backend gets restarted, too

- This goes on until the load goes down, or we add capacity

*This wouldn't be a good healthcheck in a real application!*

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Better healthchecks

- We need to make sure that the healthcheck doesn't trip when
  performance degrades due to external pressure

- Using a readiness check would have fewer effects

  (but it would still be an imperfect solution)

- A possible combination:

  - readiness check with a short timeout / low failure threshold

  - liveness check with a longer timeout / higher failure threshold

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Healthchecks for redis

- A liveness probe is enough

  (it's not useful to remove a backend from rotation when it's the only one)

- We could use an exec probe running `redis-cli ping`

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Exec probes and zombies

- When using exec probes, we should make sure that we have a *zombie reaper*

  ü§îüßêüßü Wait, what?

- When a process terminates, its parent must call `wait()`/`waitpid()`

  (this is how the parent process retrieves the child's exit status)

- In the meantime, the process is in *zombie* state

  (the process state will show as `Z` in `ps`, `top` ...)

- When a process is killed, its children are *orphaned* and attached to PID 1

- PID 1 has the responsibility of *reaping* these processes when they terminate

- OK, but how does that affect us?

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## PID 1 in containers

- On ordinary systems, PID 1 (`/sbin/init`) has logic to reap processes

- In containers, PID 1 is typically our application process

  (e.g. Apache, the JVM, NGINX, Redis ...)

- These *do not* take care of reaping orphans

- If we use exec probes, we need to add a process reaper

- We can add [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) to our images

- Or [share the PID namespace between containers of a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/)

  (and have gcr.io/pause take care of the reaping)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Healthchecks for worker

- Readiness isn't useful

  (because worker isn't a backend for a service)

- Liveness may help us restart a broken worker, but how can we check it?

- Embedding an HTTP server is an option

  (but it has a high potential for unwanted side effects and false positives)

- Using a "lease" file can be relatively easy:

  - touch a file during each iteration of the main loop

  - check the timestamp of that file from an exec probe

- Writing logs (and checking them from the probe) also works

  - the second one has these slides, some scripts, more manifests ...

.exercise[

- Clone the kubercoins repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins

- DockerCoins is *not* a cryptocurrency

  (the only common points are "randomness", "hashing", and "coins" in the name)

.debug[[k8s/kubercoins.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/kubercoins.md)]
---

## DockerCoins in the microservices era

- DockerCoins is made of 5 services:

  - `rng` = web service generating random bytes

  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data

  - `worker` = background process calling `rng` and `hasher`

  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

  - `redis` = data store (holds a counter updated by `worker`)

- These 5 services are visible in the application's Compose file,
  [docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml)

.debug[[k8s/kubercoins.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/kubercoins.md)]
---

## How DockerCoins works

- `worker` invokes web service `rng` to generate random bytes

- `worker` invokes web service `hasher` to hash these bytes

- `worker` does this in an infinite loop

- every second, `worker` updates `redis` to indicate how many loops were done

- `webui` queries `redis`, and computes and exposes "hashing speed" in our browser

*(See diagram on next slide!)*

## Service discovery in container-land

How does each service find out the address of the other ones?

--

- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code

- We do not hard-code FQDNs in the code, either

- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest

  (And by container-magic, we mean "a crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server")

## Example in `worker/worker.py`

```python
redis = Redis("`redis`")


def get_random_bytes():
    r = requests.get("http://`rng`/32")
    return r.content


def hash_bytes(data):
    r = requests.post("http://`hasher`/",
                      data=data,
                      headers={"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"})
```

## Show me the code!

- You can check the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- The Compose file ([docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml))
  lists all 5 services

- `redis` is using an official image from the Docker Hub

- `hasher`, `rng`, `worker`, `webui` are each built from a Dockerfile

- Each service's Dockerfile and source code is in its own directory

  (`hasher` is in the [hasher](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/) directory,
  `rng` is in the [rng](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/)
  directory, etc.)

.debug[[k8s/kubercoins.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/kubercoins.md)]

## Our application at work

- We can check the logs of our application's pods

.exercise[

- Check the logs of the various components:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker
  kubectl logs deploy/hasher
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubercoins.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/kubercoins.md)]
---

## Connecting to the web UI

- "Logs are exciting and fun!" (No-one, ever)

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.exercise[

- Check the NodePort allocated to the web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc webui
  ```

- Open that in a web browser

]

A drawing area should show up, and after a few seconds, a blue
graph will appear.

# Accessing logs from the CLI

- The `kubectl logs` command has limitations:

  - it cannot stream logs from multiple pods at a time

  - when showing logs from multiple pods, it mixes them all together

- We are going to see how to do it better

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Doing it manually

- We *could* (if we were so inclined) write a program or script that would:

  - take a selector as an argument

  - enumerate all pods matching that selector (with `kubectl get -l ...`)

  - fork one `kubectl logs --follow ...` command per container

  - annotate the logs (the output of each `kubectl logs ...` process) with their origin

  - preserve ordering by using `kubectl logs --timestamps ...` and merge the output

--

- We *could* do it, but thankfully, others did it for us already!

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]

## Stern

[Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) is an open source project
by [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

From the README:

*Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.*

*The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.*

Exactly what we need!

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Installing Stern

- Run `stern` (without arguments) to check if it's installed:

  ```
  $ stern
  Tail multiple pods and containers from Kubernetes

  Usage:
    stern pod-query [flags]
  ```

- If it is not installed, the easiest method is to download a [binary release](https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases)

- The following commands will install Stern on a Linux Intel 64 bit machine:
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/stern \
       https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases/download/1.11.0/stern_linux_amd64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stern
  ```

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern

- There are two ways to specify the pods whose logs we want to see:

  - `-l` followed by a selector expression (like with many `kubectl` commands)

  - with a "pod query," i.e. a regex used to match pod names

- These two ways can be combined if necessary

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the rng containers:
  ```bash
  stern ping
  ```

<!--
```wait HTTP/1.1```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern convenient options

- The `--tail N` flag shows the last `N` lines for each container

  (Instead of showing the logs since the creation of the container)

- The `-t` / `--timestamps` flag shows timestamps

- The `--all-namespaces` flag is self-explanatory

.exercise[

- View what's up with the `weave` system containers:
  ```bash
  stern --tail 1 --timestamps --all-namespaces weave
  ```

<!--
```wait weave-npc```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern with a selector

- When specifying a selector, we can omit the value for a label

- This will match all objects having that label (regardless of the value)

- Everything created with `kubectl run` has a label `run`

- We can use that property to view the logs of all the pods created with `kubectl run`

- Similarly, everything created with `kubectl create deployment` has a label `app`

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the things started with `kubectl run`:
  ```bash
  stern -l run
  ```

<!--
```wait units of work```
```keys ^C```

# Centralized logging

- Using `kubectl` or `stern` is simple; but it has drawbacks:

  - when a node goes down, its logs are not available anymore

  - we can only dump or stream logs; we want to search/index/count...

- We want to send all our logs to a single place

- We want to parse them (e.g. for HTTP logs) and index them

- We want a nice web dashboard

--

- We are going to deploy an EFK stack

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## What is EFK?

- EFK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Fluentd (to get container logs, process them, and put them in ElasticSearch)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we need to access from outside the cluster will be Kibana

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Deploying EFK on our cluster

- We are going to use a YAML file describing all the required resources

.exercise[

- Load the YAML file into our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/efk.yaml
  ```

]

If we [look at the YAML file](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/k8s/efk.yaml), we see that
it creates a daemon set, two deployments, two services,
and a few roles and role bindings (to give fluentd the required permissions).

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (before Fluentd)

- A container writes a line on stdout or stderr

- Both are typically piped to the container engine (Docker or otherwise)

- The container engine reads the line, and sends it to a logging driver

- The timestamp and stream (stdout or stderr) is added to the log line

- With the default configuration for Kubernetes, the line is written to a JSON file

  (`/var/log/containers/pod-name_namespace_container-id.log`)

- That file is read when we invoke `kubectl logs`; we can access it directly too

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (with Fluentd)

- Fluentd runs on each node (thanks to a daemon set)

- It bind-mounts `/var/log/containers` from the host (to access these files)

- It continuously scans this directory for new files; reads them; parses them

- Each log line becomes a JSON object, fully annotated with extra information:
  <br/>container id, pod name, Kubernetes labels...

- These JSON objects are stored in ElasticSearch

- ElasticSearch indexes the JSON objects

- We can access the logs through Kibana (and perform searches, counts, etc.)

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Accessing Kibana

- Kibana offers a web interface that is relatively straightforward

- Let's check it out!

.exercise[

- Check which `NodePort` was allocated to Kibana:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kibana
  ```

- With our web browser, connect to Kibana

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Using Kibana

*Note: this is not a Kibana workshop! So this section is deliberately very terse.*

- The first time you connect to Kibana, you must "configure an index pattern"

- Just use the one that is suggested, `@timestamp`.red[*]

- Then click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)

- You should see container logs

- Advice: in the left column, select a few fields to display, e.g.:

  `kubernetes.host`, `kubernetes.pod_name`, `stream`, `log`

.red[*]If you don't see `@timestamp`, it's probably because no logs exist yet.
<br/>Wait a bit, and double-check the logging pipeline!

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Caveat emptor

We are using EFK because it is relatively straightforward
to deploy on Kubernetes, without having to redeploy or reconfigure
our cluster. But it doesn't mean that it will always be the best
option for your use-case. If you are running Kubernetes in the
cloud, you might consider using the cloud provider's logging
infrastructure (if it can be integrated with Kubernetes).

The deployment method that we will use here has been simplified:
there is only one ElasticSearch node. In a real deployment, you
might use a cluster, both for performance and reliability reasons.
But this is outside of the scope of this chapter.

The YAML file that we used creates all the resources in the
`default` namespace, for simplicity. In a real scenario, you will
create the resources in the `kube-system` namespace or in a dedicated namespace.

# Authentication and authorization

*And first, a little refresher!*

- Authentication = verifying the identity of a person

  On a UNIX system, we can authenticate with login+password, SSH keys ...

- Authorization = listing what they are allowed to do

  On a UNIX system, this can include file permissions, sudoer entries ...

- Sometimes abbreviated as "authn" and "authz"

- In good modular systems, these things are decoupled

   (so we can e.g. change a password or SSH key without having to reset access rights)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication in Kubernetes

- When the API server receives a request, it tries to authenticate it

  (it examines headers, certificates... anything available)

- Many authentication methods are available and can be used simultaneously

  (we will see them on the next slide)

- It's the job of the authentication method to produce:

  - the user name
  - the user ID
  - a list of groups

- The API server doesn't interpret these; that'll be the job of *authorizers*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication methods

- TLS client certificates

  (that's what we've been doing with `kubectl` so far)

- Bearer tokens

  (a secret token in the HTTP headers of the request)

- [HTTP basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

  (carrying user and password in an HTTP header)

- Authentication proxy

  (sitting in front of the API and setting trusted headers)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Anonymous requests

- If any authentication method *rejects* a request, it's denied

  (`401 Unauthorized` HTTP code)

- If a request is neither rejected nor accepted by anyone, it's anonymous

  - the user name is `system:anonymous`

  - the list of groups is `[system:unauthenticated]`

- By default, the anonymous user can't do anything

  (that's what you get if you just `curl` the Kubernetes API)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with TLS certificates

- This is enabled in most Kubernetes deployments

- The user name is derived from the `CN` in the client certificates

- The groups are derived from the `O` fields in the client certificate

- From the point of view of the Kubernetes API, users do not exist

  (i.e. they are not stored in etcd or anywhere else)

- Users can be created (and added to groups) independently of the API

- The Kubernetes API can be set up to use your custom CA to validate client certs

## Viewing our admin certificate

- Let's inspect the certificate we've been using all this time!

.exercise[

- This command will show the `CN` and `O` fields for our certificate:
  ```bash
  kubectl config view \
          --raw \
          -o json \
          | jq -r .users[0].user[\"client-certificate-data\"] \
          | openssl base64 -d -A \
          | openssl x509 -text \
          | grep Subject:
  ```

]

Let's break down that command together! üòÖ

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Breaking down the command

- `kubectl config view` shows the Kubernetes user configuration
- `--raw` includes certificate information (which shows as REDACTED otherwise)
- `-o json` outputs the information in JSON format
- `| jq ...` extracts the field with the user certificate (in base64)
- `| openssl base64 -d -A` decodes the base64 format (now we have a PEM file)
- `| openssl x509 -text` parses the certificate and outputs it as plain text
- `| grep Subject:` shows us the line that interests us

‚Üí We are user `kubernetes-admin`, in group `system:masters`.

(We will see later how and why this gives us the permissions that we have.)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## User certificates in practice

- The Kubernetes API server does not support certificate revocation

  (see issue [#18982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18982))

- As a result, we don't have an easy way to terminate someone's access

  (if their key is compromised, or they leave the organization)

- Option 1: re-create a new CA and re-issue everyone's certificates 
  <br/>
  ‚Üí Maybe OK if we only have a few users; no way otherwise

- Option 2: don't use groups; grant permissions to individual users
  <br/>
  ‚Üí Inconvenient if we have many users and teams; error-prone

- Option 3: issue short-lived certificates (e.g. 24 hours) and renew them often
  <br/>
  ‚Üí This can be facilitated by e.g. Vault or by the Kubernetes CSR API

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with tokens

- Tokens are passed as HTTP headers:

  `Authorization: Bearer and-then-here-comes-the-token`

- Tokens can be validated through a number of different methods:

  - static tokens hard-coded in a file on the API server

  - [bootstrap tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) (special case to create a cluster or join nodes)

  - [OpenID Connect tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) (to delegate authentication to compatible OAuth2 providers)

  - service accounts (these deserve more details, coming right up!)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Service accounts

- A service account is a user that exists in the Kubernetes API

  (it is visible with e.g. `kubectl get serviceaccounts`)

- Service accounts can therefore be created / updated dynamically

  (they don't require hand-editing a file and restarting the API server)

- A service account is associated with a set of secrets

  (the kind that you can view with `kubectl get secrets`)

- Service accounts are generally used to grant permissions to applications, services...

  (as opposed to humans)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]

class: extra-details

## Token authentication in practice

- We are going to list existing service accounts

- Then we will extract the token for a given service account

- And we will use that token to authenticate with the API

---

class: extra-details

## Listing service accounts

.exercise[

- The resource name is `serviceaccount` or `sa` for short:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa
  ```

]

There should be just one service account in the default namespace: `default`.

## Finding the secret

.exercise[

- List the secrets for the `default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa default -o yaml
  SECRET=$(kubectl get sa default -o json | jq -r .secrets[0].name)
  ```

]

It should be named `default-token-XXXXX`.

---

class: extra-details

## Extracting the token

- The token is stored in the secret, wrapped with base64 encoding

.exercise[

- View the secret:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret $SECRET -o yaml
  ```

- Extract the token and decode it:
  ```bash
  TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET -o json \
          | jq -r .data.token | openssl base64 -d -A)
  ```

]

## Using the token

- Let's send a request to the API, without and with the token

.exercise[

- Find the ClusterIP for the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  API=$(kubectl get svc kubernetes -o json | jq -r .spec.clusterIP)
  ```

- Connect without the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://$API
  ```

- Connect with the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://$API
  ```

]

class: extra-details

## Results

- In both cases, we will get a "Forbidden" error

- Without authentication, the user is `system:anonymous`

- With authentication, it is shown as `system:serviceaccount:default:default`

- The API "sees" us as a different user

- But neither user has any rights, so we can't do nothin'

- Let's change that!

## Authorization in Kubernetes

- There are multiple ways to grant permissions in Kubernetes, called [authorizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#authorization-modules):

  - [Node Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) (used internally by kubelet; we can ignore it)

  - [Attribute-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/) (powerful but complex and static; ignore it too)

  - [Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/) (each API request is submitted to an external service for approval)

  - [Role-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (associates permissions to users dynamically)

- The one we want is the last one, generally abbreviated as RBAC

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Role-based access control

- RBAC allows to specify fine-grained permissions

- Permissions are expressed as *rules*

- A rule is a combination of:

  - [verbs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#determine-the-request-verb) like create, get, list, update, delete...

  - resources (as in "API resource," like pods, nodes, services...)

  - resource names (to specify e.g. one specific pod instead of all pods)

  - in some case, [subresources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-resources) (e.g. logs are subresources of pods)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## From rules to roles to rolebindings

- A *role* is an API object containing a list of *rules*

  Example: role "external-load-balancer-configurator" can:
  - [list, get] resources [endpoints, services, pods]
  - [update] resources [services]

- A *rolebinding* associates a role with a user

  Example: rolebinding "external-load-balancer-configurator":
  - associates user "external-load-balancer-configurator"
  - with role "external-load-balancer-configurator"

- Yes, there can be users, roles, and rolebindings with the same name

- It's a good idea for 1-1-1 bindings; not so much for 1-N ones

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Cluster-scope permissions

- API resources Role and RoleBinding are for objects within a namespace

- We can also define API resources ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

- These are a superset, allowing us to:

  - specify actions on cluster-wide objects (like nodes)

  - operate across all namespaces

- We can create Role and RoleBinding resources within a namespace

- ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding resources are global

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Pods and service accounts

- A pod can be associated with a service account

  - by default, it is associated with the `default` service account

  - as we saw earlier, this service account has no permissions anyway

- The associated token is exposed to the pod's filesystem

  (in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)

- Standard Kubernetes tooling (like `kubectl`) will look for it there

- So Kubernetes tools running in a pod will automatically use the service account

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to create a service account

- We will use a default cluster role (`view`)

- We will bind together this role and this service account

- Then we will run a pod using that service account

- In this pod, we will install `kubectl` and check our permissions

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Creating a service account

- We will call the new service account `viewer`

  (note that nothing prevents us from calling it `view`, like the role)

.exercise[

- Create the new service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create serviceaccount viewer
  ```

- List service accounts now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get serviceaccounts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Binding a role to the service account

- Binding a role = creating a *rolebinding* object

- We will call that object `viewercanview`

  (but again, we could call it `view`)

.exercise[

- Create the new role binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl create rolebinding viewercanview \
          --clusterrole=view \
          --serviceaccount=default:viewer
  ```

]

It's important to note a couple of details in these flags...

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Roles vs Cluster Roles

- We used `--clusterrole=view`

- What would have happened if we had used `--role=view`?

  - we would have bound the role `view` from the local namespace
    <br/>(instead of the cluster role `view`)

  - the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - but later, our API requests would have been denied

- This is a deliberate design decision

  (we can reference roles that don't exist, and create/update them later)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Users vs Service Accounts

- We used `--serviceaccount=default:viewer`

- What would have happened if we had used `--user=default:viewer`?

  - we would have bound the role to a user instead of a service account

  - again, the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - ...but our API requests would have been denied later

- What's about the `default:` prefix?

  - that's the namespace of the service account

  - yes, it could be inferred from context, but... `kubectl` requires it

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing

- We will run an `alpine` pod and install `kubectl` there

.exercise[

- Run a one-time pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl run eyepod --rm -ti --restart=Never \
          --serviceaccount=viewer \
          --image alpine
  ```

- Install `curl`, then use it to install `kubectl`:
  ```bash
  apk add --no-cache curl
  URLBASE=https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release
  KUBEVER=$(curl -s $URLBASE/stable.txt)
  curl -LO $URLBASE/$KUBEVER/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
  chmod +x kubectl
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Running `kubectl` in the pod

- We'll try to use our `view` permissions, then to create an object

.exercise[

- Check that we can, indeed, view things:
  ```bash
  ./kubectl get all
  ```

- But that we can't create things:
  ```
  ./kubectl create deployment testrbac --image=nginx
  ```

- Exit the container with `exit` or `^D`

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing directly with `kubectl`

- We can also check for permission with `kubectl auth can-i`:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes
  kubectl auth can-i create pods
  kubectl auth can-i get pod/name-of-pod
  kubectl auth can-i get /url-fragment-of-api-request/
  kubectl auth can-i '*' services
  ```

- And we can check permissions on behalf of other users:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as some-user
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name-of-service-account>
  ```

---

## Where does this `view` role come from?

- Kubernetes defines a number of ClusterRoles intended to be bound to users

- `cluster-admin` can do *everything* (think `root` on UNIX)

- `admin` can do *almost everything* (except e.g. changing resource quotas and limits)

- `edit` is similar to `admin`, but cannot view or edit permissions

- `view` has read-only access to most resources, except permissions and secrets

*In many situations, these roles will be all you need.*

*You can also customize them!*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Customizing the default roles

- If you need to *add* permissions to these default roles (or others),
  <br/>
  you can do it through the [ClusterRole Aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) mechanism

- This happens by creating a ClusterRole with the following labels:
  ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
  ```

- This ClusterRole permissions will be added to `admin`/`edit`/`view` respectively

- This is particulary useful when using CustomResourceDefinitions

  (since Kubernetes cannot guess which resources are sensitive and which ones aren't)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Where do our permissions come from?

- When interacting with the Kubernetes API, we are using a client certificate

- We saw previously that this client certificate contained:

  `CN=kubernetes-admin` and `O=system:masters`

- Let's look for these in existing ClusterRoleBindings:
  ```bash
  kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml | 
    grep -e kubernetes-admin -e system:masters
  ```

  (`system:masters` should show up, but not `kubernetes-admin`.)

- Where does this match come from?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The `system:masters` group

- If we eyeball the output of `kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml`, we'll find out!

- It is in the `cluster-admin` binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrolebinding cluster-admin
  ```

- This binding associates `system:masters` with the cluster role `cluster-admin`

- And the `cluster-admin` is, basically, `root`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
  ```

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Figuring out who can do what

- For auditing purposes, sometimes we want to know who can perform an action

- There is a proof-of-concept tool by Aqua Security which does exactly that:

  https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can

- This is one way to install it:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/go/bin golang \
         go get -v github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can
  ```

- This is one way to use it:
  ```bash
  kubectl-who-can create pods
  ```

# The CSR API

- The Kubernetes API exposes CSR resources

- We can use these resources to issue TLS certificates

- First, we will go through a quick reminder about TLS certificates

- Then, we will see how to obtain a certificate for a user

- We will use that certificate to authenticate with the cluster

- Finally, we will grant some privileges to that user

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Reminder about TLS

- TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol providing:

  - encryption (to prevent eavesdropping)

  - authentication (using public key cryptography)

- When we access an https:// URL, the server authenticates itself

  (it proves its identity to us; as if it were "showing its ID")

- But we can also have mutual TLS authentication (mTLS)

  (client proves its identity to server; server proves its identity to client)

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Authentication with certificates

- To authenticate, someone (client or server) needs:

  - a *private key* (that remains known only to them)

  - a *public key* (that they can distribute)

  - a *certificate* (associating the public key with an identity)

- A message encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key

  (and vice versa)

- If I use someone's public key to encrypt/decrypt their messages,
  <br/>
  I can be certain that I am talking to them / they are talking to me

- The certificate proves that I have the correct public key for them

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Certificate generation workflow

This is what I do if I want to obtain a certificate.

1. Create public and private keys.

2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

   (The CSR contains the identity that I claim and a public key.)

3. Send that CSR to the Certificate Authority (CA).

4. The CA verifies that I can claim the identity in the CSR.

5. The CA generates my certificate and gives it to me.

The CA (or anyone else) never needs to know my private key.

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## The CSR API

- The Kubernetes API has a CertificateSigningRequest resource type

  (we can list them with e.g. `kubectl get csr`)

- We can create a CSR object

  (= upload a CSR to the Kubernetes API)

- Then, using the Kubernetes API, we can approve/deny the request

- If we approve the request, the Kubernetes API generates a certificate

- The certificate gets attached to the CSR object and can be retrieved

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Using the CSR API

- We will show how to use the CSR API to obtain user certificates

- This will be a rather complex demo

- ... And yet, we will take a few shortcuts to simplify it

  (but it will illustrate the general idea)

- The demo also won't be automated

  (we would have to write extra code to make it fully functional)

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## General idea

- We will create a Namespace named "users"

- Each user will get a ServiceAccount in that Namespace

- That ServiceAccount will give read/write access to *one* CSR object

- Users will use that ServiceAccount's token to submit a CSR

- We will approve the CSR (or not)

- Users can then retrieve their certificate from their CSR object

- ...And use that certificate for subsequent interactions

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Resource naming

For a user named `jean.doe`, we will have:

- ServiceAccount `jean.doe` in Namespace `users`

- CertificateSigningRequest `users:jean.doe`

- ClusterRole `users:jean.doe` giving read/write access to that CSR

- ClusterRoleBinding `users:jean.doe` binding ClusterRole and ServiceAccount

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Creating the user's resources

.warning[If you want to use another name than `jean.doe`, update the YAML file!]

.exercise[

- Create the global namespace for all users:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace users
  ```

- Create the ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding for `jean.doe`:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/users:jean.doe.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Extracting the user's token

- Let's obtain the user's token and give it to them

  (the token will be their password)

.exercise[

- List the user's secrets:
  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace=users describe serviceaccount jean.doe
  ```

- Show the user's token:
  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace=users describe secret `jean.doe-token-xxxxx`
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Configure `kubectl` to use the token

- Let's create a new context that will use that token to access the API

.exercise[

- Add a new identity to our kubeconfig file:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-credentials token:jean.doe --token=...
  ```

- Add a new context using that identity:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context jean.doe --user=token:jean.doe --cluster=kubernetes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Access the API with the token

- Let's check that our access rights are set properly

.exercise[

- Try to access any resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
  (This should tell us "Forbidden")

- Try to access "our" CertificateSigningRequest:
  ```bash
  kubectl get csr users:jean.doe
  ```
  (This should tell us "NotFound")

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Create a key and a CSR

- There are many tools to generate TLS keys and CSRs

- Let's use OpenSSL; it's not the best one, but it's installed everywhere

  (many people prefer cfssl, easyrsa, or other tools; that's fine too!)

.exercise[

- Generate the key and certificate signing request:
  ```bash
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem \
                -new -subj /CN=jean.doe/O=devs/ -out csr.pem
  ```

]

The command above generates:

- a 2048-bit RSA key, without encryption, stored in key.pem
- a CSR for the name `jean.doe` in group `devs`

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Inside the Kubernetes CSR object

- The Kubernetes CSR object is a thin wrapper around the CSR PEM file

- The PEM file needs to be encoded to base64 on a single line

  (we will use `base64 -w0` for that purpose)

- The Kubernetes CSR object also needs to list the right "usages"

  (these are flags indicating how the certificate can be used)

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Sending the CSR to Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Generate and create the CSR resource:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: CertificateSigningRequest
    metadata:
      name: users:jean.doe
    spec:
      request: $(base64 -w0 < csr.pem)
      usages:
      - digital signature
      - key encipherment
      - client auth
    EOF
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Adjusting certificate expiration

- By default, the CSR API generates certificates valid 1 year

- We want to generate short-lived certificates, so we will lower that to 1 hour

- Fow now, this is configured [through an experimental controller manager flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67324)

.exercise[

- Edit the static pod definition for the controller manager:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
  ```

- In the list of flags, add the following line:
  ```bash
  - --experimental-cluster-signing-duration=1h
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Verifying and approving the CSR

- Let's inspect the CSR, and if it is valid, approve it

.exercise[

- Switch back to `cluster-admin`:
  ```bash
  kctx -
  ```

- Inspect the CSR:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe csr users:jean.doe
  ```

- Approve it:
  ```bash
  kubectl certificate approve users:jean.doe
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Obtaining the certificate

.exercise[

- Switch back to the user's identity:
  ```bash
  kctx -
  ```

- Retrieve the updated CSR object and extract the certificate:
  ```bash
  kubectl get csr users:jean.doe \
          -o jsonpath={.status.certificate} \
          | base64 -d > cert.pem
  ```

- Inspect the certificate:
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Using the certificate

.exercise[

- Add the key and certificate to kubeconfig:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-credentials cert:jean.doe --embed-certs \
          --client-certificate=cert.pem --client-key=key.pem
  ```

- Update the user's context to use the key and cert to authenticate:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context jean.doe --user cert:jean.doe
  ```

- Confirm that we are seen as `jean.doe` (but don't have permissions):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## What's missing?

We have just shown, step by step, a method to issue short-lived certificates for users.

To be usable in real environments, we would need to add:

- a kubectl helper to automatically generate the CSR and obtain the cert

  (and transparently renew the cert when needed)

- a Kubernetes controller to automatically validate and approve CSRs

  (checking that the subject and groups are valid)

- a way for the users to know the groups to add to their CSR

  (e.g.: annotations on their ServiceAccount + read access to the ServiceAccount)

.debug[[k8s/csr-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/csr-api.md)]
---

## Is this realistic?

- Larger organizations typically integrate with their own directory

- The general principle, however, is the same:

  - users have long-term credentials (password, token, ...)

  - they use these credentials to obtain other, short-lived credentials

- This provides enhanced security:

  - the long-term credentials can use long passphrases, 2FA, HSM...

  - the short-term credentials are more convenient to use

  - we get strong security *and* convenience

- Systems like Vault also have certificate issuance mechanisms

# OpenID Connect

- The Kubernetes API server can perform authentication with OpenID connect

- This requires an *OpenID provider*

  (external authorization server using the OAuth 2.0 protocol)

- We can use a third-party provider (e.g. Google) or run our own (e.g. Dex)

- We are going to give an overview of the protocol

- We will show it in action (in a simplified scenario)

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Workflow overview

- We want to access our resources (a Kubernetes cluster)

- We authenticate with the OpenID provider

  - we can do this directly (e.g. by going to https://accounts.google.com)

  - or maybe a kubectl plugin can open a browser page on our behalf

- After authenticating us, the OpenID provider gives us:

  - an *id token* (a short-lived signed JSON Web Token, see next slide)

  - a *refresh token* (to renew the *id token* when needed)

- We can now issue requests to the Kubernetes API with the *id token*

- The API server will verify that token's content to authenticate us

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## JSON Web Tokens

- A JSON Web Token (JWT) has three parts:

  - a header specifying algorithms and token type

  - a payload (indicating who issued the token, for whom, which purposes...)

  - a signature generated by the issuer (the issuer = the OpenID provider)

- Anyone can verify a JWT without contacting the issuer

  (except to obtain the issuer's public key)

- Pro tip: we can inspect a JWT with https://jwt.io/

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## How the Kubernetes API uses JWT

- Server side

  - enable OIDC authentication

  - indicate which issuer (provider) should be allowed

  - indicate which audience (or "client id") should be allowed

  - optionally, map or prefix user and group names

- Client side

  - obtain JWT as described earlier

  - pass JWT as authentication token

  - renew JWT when needed (using the refresh token)

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Demo time!

- We will use [Google Accounts](https://accounts.google.com) as our OpenID provider

- We will use the [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) as the "audience" or "client id"

- We will obtain a JWT through Google Accounts and the OAuth Playground

- We will enable OIDC in the Kubernetes API server

- We will use the JWT to authenticate

.footnote[If you can't or won't use a Google account, you can try to adapt this to another provider.]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Checking the API server logs

- The API server logs will be particularly useful in this section

  (they will indicate e.g. why a specific token is rejected)

- Let's keep an eye on the API server output!

.exercise[

- Tail the logs of the API server:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs kube-apiserver-node1 --follow --namespace=kube-system
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Authenticate with the OpenID provider

- We will use the Google OAuth Playground for convenience

- In a real scenario, we would need our own OAuth client instead of the playground

  (even if we were still using Google as the OpenID provider)

.exercise[

- Open the Google OAuth Playground:
  ```
  https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
  ```

- Enter our own custom scope in the text field:
  ```
  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
  ```

- Click on "Authorize APIs" and allow the playground to access our email address

]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Obtain our JSON Web Token

- The previous step gave us an "authorization code"

- We will use it to obtain tokens

.exercise[

- Click on "Exchange authorization code for tokens"

]

- The JWT is the very long `id_token` that shows up on the right hand side

  (it is a base64-encoded JSON object, and should therefore start with `eyJ`)

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Using our JSON Web Token

- We need to create a context (in kubeconfig) for our token

  (if we just add the token or use `kubectl --token`, our certificate will still be used)

.exercise[

- Create a new authentication section in kubeconfig:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-credentials myjwt --token=eyJ...
  ```

- Try to use it:
  ```bash
  kubectl --user=myjwt get nodes
  ```

]

We should get an `Unauthorized` response, since we haven't enabled OpenID Connect in the API server yet. We should also see `invalid bearer token` in the API server log output.

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Enabling OpenID Connect

- We need to add a few flags to the API server configuration

- These two are mandatory:

  `--oidc-issuer-url` ‚Üí URL of the OpenID provider

  `--oidc-client-id` ‚Üí app requesting the authentication
  <br/>(in our case, that's the ID for the Google OAuth Playground)

- This one is optional:

  `--oidc-username-claim` ‚Üí which field should be used as user name
  <br/>(we will use the user's email address instead of an opaque ID)

- See the [API server documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server
) for more details about all available flags

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Updating the API server configuration

- The instructions below will work for clusters deployed with kubeadm

  (or where the control plane is deployed in static pods)

- If your cluster is deployed differently, you will need to adapt them

.exercise[

- Edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`

- Add the following lines to the list of command-line flags:
  ```yaml
  - --oidc-issuer-url=https://accounts.google.com
  - --oidc-client-id=407408718192.apps.googleusercontent.com
  - --oidc-username-claim=email
  ```
]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Restarting the API server

- The kubelet monitors the files in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

- When we save the pod manifest, kubelet will restart the corresponding pod

  (using the updated command line flags)

.exercise[

- After making the changes described on the previous slide, save the file

- Issue a simple command (like `kubectl version`) until the API server is back up

  (it might take between a few seconds and one minute for the API server to restart)

- Restart the `kubectl logs` command to view the logs of the API server

]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Using our JSON Web Token

- Now that the API server is set up to recognize our token, try again!

.exercise[

- Try an API command with our token:
  ```bash
  kubectl --user=myjwt get nodes
  kubectl --user=myjwt get pods
  ```

]

We should see a message like:
```
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "jean.doe@gmail.com"
cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```

‚Üí We were successfully *authenticated*, but not *authorized*.

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## Authorizing our user

- As an extra step, let's grant read access to our user

- We will use the pre-defined ClusterRole `view`

.exercise[

- Create a ClusterRoleBinding allowing us to view resources:
  ```bash
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding i-can-view \
            --user=`jean.doe@gmail.com` --clusterrole=view
  ```

  (make sure to put *your* Google email address there)

- Confirm that we can now list pods with our token:
   ```bash
  kubectl --user=myjwt get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

## From demo to production

.warning[This was a very simplified demo! In a real deployment...]

- We wouldn't use the Google OAuth Playground

- We *probably* wouldn't even use Google at all

  (it doesn't seem to provide a way to include groups!)

- Some popular alternatives:

  - [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex),
    [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
    (self-hosted)

  - [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/how-to/creating-token-with-groups-claim/#step-five-decode-the-jwt-to-verify)
    (SaaS)

- We would use a helper (like the [kubelogin](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin) plugin) to automatically obtain tokens

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Service Account tokens

- The tokens used by Service Accounts are JWT tokens as well

- They are signed and verified using a special service account key pair

.exercise[

- Extract the token of a service account in the current namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secrets -o jsonpath={..token} | base64 -d
  ```

- Copy-paste the token to a verification service like https://jwt.io 

- Notice that it says "Invalid Signature"

]

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Verifying Service Account tokens

- JSON Web Tokens embed the URL of the "issuer" (=OpenID provider)

- The issuer provides its public key through a well-known discovery endpoint

  (similar to https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration)

- There is no such endpoint for the Service Account key pair

- But we can provide the public key ourselves for verification

.debug[[k8s/openid-connect.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/openid-connect.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Verifying a Service Account token

- On clusters provisioned with kubeadm, the Service Account key pair is:

  `/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.key` (used by the controller manager to generate tokens)

  `/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.pub` (used by the API server to validate the same tokens)

.exercise[

- Display the public key used to sign Service Account tokens:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.pub
  ```

- Copy-paste the key in the "verify signature" area on https://jwt.io

- It should now say "Signature Verified"

# Securing the control plane

- Many components accept connections (and requests) from others:

  - API server

  - etcd

  - kubelet

- We must secure these connections:

  - to deny unauthorized requests

  - to prevent eavesdropping secrets, tokens, and other sensitive information

- Disabling authentication and/or authorization is **strongly discouraged**

  (but it's possible to do it, e.g. for learning / troubleshooting purposes)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Authentication and authorization

- Authentication (checking "who you are") is done with mutual TLS

 (both the client and the server need to hold a valid certificate)

- Authorization (checking "what you can do") is done in different ways

  - the API server implements a sophisticated permission logic (with RBAC)
  
  - some services will defer authorization to the API server (through webhooks)

  - some services require a certificate signed by a particular CA / sub-CA

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## In practice

- We will review the various communication channels in the control plane

- We will describe how they are secured

- When TLS certificates are used, we will indicate:

  - which CA signs them

  - what their subject (CN) should be, when applicable

- We will indicate how to configure security (client- and server-side)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## etcd peers

- Replication and coordination of etcd happens on a dedicated port

  (typically port 2380; the default port for normal client connections is 2379)

- Authentication uses TLS certificates with a separate sub-CA

  (otherwise, anyone with a Kubernetes client certificate could access etcd!)

- The etcd command line flags involved are:

   `--peer-client-cert-auth=true` to activate it

   `--peer-cert-file`, `--peer-key-file`, `--peer-trusted-ca-file`

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## etcd clients

- The only¬π thing that connects to etcd is the API server

- Authentication uses TLS certificates with a separate sub-CA

  (for the same reasons as for etcd inter-peer authentication)

- The etcd command line flags involved are:

  `--client-cert-auth=true` to activate it

  `--trusted-ca-file`, `--cert-file`, `--key-file`

- The API server command line flags involved are:

  `--etcd-cafile`, `--etcd-certfile`, `--etcd-keyfile`

.footnote[¬πTechnically, there is also the etcd healthcheck. Let's ignore it for now.]

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## API server clients

- The API server has a sophisticated authentication and authorization system

- For connections coming from other components of the control plane:

  - authentication uses certificates (trusting the certificates' subject or CN)

  - authorization uses whatever mechanism is enabled (most oftentimes, RBAC)

- The relevant API server flags are:

  `--client-ca-file`, `--tls-cert-file`, `--tls-private-key-file`

- Each component connecting to the API server takes a `--kubeconfig` flag

  (to specify a kubeconfig file containing the CA cert, client key, and client cert)

- Yes, that kubeconfig file follows the same format as our `~/.kube/config` file!

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Kubelet and API server

- Communication between kubelet and API server can be established both ways

- Kubelet ‚Üí API server:

  - kubelet registers itself ("hi, I'm node42, do you have work for me?")

  - connection is kept open and re-established if it breaks

  - that's how the kubelet knows which pods to start/stop

- API server ‚Üí kubelet:

  - used to retrieve logs, exec, attach to containers

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Kubelet ‚Üí API server

- Kubelet is started with `--kubeconfig` with API server information

- The client certificate of the kubelet will typically have:

  `CN=system:node:<nodename>` and groups `O=system:nodes`

- Nothing special on the API server side

  (it will authenticate like any other client)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## API server ‚Üí kubelet

- Kubelet is started with the flag `--client-ca-file`

  (typically using the same CA as the API server)

- API server will use a dedicated key pair when contacting kubelet

  (specified with `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key`)

- Authorization uses webhooks

  (enabled with `--authorization-mode=Webhook` on kubelet)

- The webhook server is the API server itself

  (the kubelet sends back a request to the API server to ask, "can this person do that?")

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Scheduler

- The scheduler connects to the API server like an ordinary client

- The certificate of the scheduler will have `CN=system:kube-scheduler`

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Controller manager

- The controller manager is also a normal client to the API server

- Its certificate will have `CN=system:kube-controller-manager`

- If we use the CSR API, the controller manager needs the CA cert and key

  (passed with flags `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file`)

- We usually want the controller manager to generate tokens for service accounts

- These tokens deserve some details (on the next slide!)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Service account tokens

- Each time we create a service account, the controller manager generates a token

- These tokens are JWT tokens, signed with a particular key

- These tokens are used for authentication with the API server

  (and therefore, the API server needs to be able to verify their integrity)

- This uses another keypair:

  - the private key (used for signature) is passed to the controller manager
    <br/>(using flags `--service-account-private-key-file` and `--root-ca-file`)

  - the public key (used for verification) is passed to the API server
    <br/>(using flag `--service-account-key-file`)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## kube-proxy

- kube-proxy is "yet another API server client"

- In many clusters, it runs as a Daemon Set

- In that case, it will have its own Service Account and associated permissions

- It will authenticate using the token of that Service Account

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Webhooks

- We mentioned webhooks earlier; how does that really work?

- The Kubernetes API has special resource types to check permissions

- One of them is SubjectAccessReview

- To check if a particular user can do a particular action on a particular resource:

  - we prepare a SubjectAccessReview object

  - we send that object to the API server

  - the API server responds with allow/deny (and optional explanations)

- Using webhooks for authorization = sending SAR to authorize each request

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Subject Access Review

Here is an example showing how to check if `jean.doe` can `get` some `pods` in `kube-system`:

```bash
kubectl -v9 create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: SubjectAccessReview
spec:
  user: jean.doe
  group:
  - foo
  - bar
  resourceAttributes:
    #group: blah.k8s.io
    namespace: kube-system
    resource: pods
    verb: get
    #name: web-xyz1234567-pqr89
EOF
```

# Network policies

- Namespaces help us to *organize* resources

- Namespaces do not provide isolation

- By default, every pod can contact every other pod

- By default, every service accepts traffic from anyone

- If we want this to be different, we need *network policies*

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## What's a network policy?

A network policy is defined by the following things.

- A *pod selector* indicating which pods it applies to

  e.g.: "all pods in namespace `blue` with the label `zone=internal`"

- A list of *ingress rules* indicating which inbound traffic is allowed

  e.g.: "TCP connections to ports 8000 and 8080 coming from pods with label `zone=dmz`,
  and from the external subnet 4.42.6.0/24, except 4.42.6.5"

- A list of *egress rules* indicating which outbound traffic is allowed

A network policy can provide ingress rules, egress rules, or both.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## How do network policies apply?

- A pod can be "selected" by any number of network policies

- If a pod isn't selected by any network policy, then its traffic is unrestricted

  (In other words: in the absence of network policies, all traffic is allowed)

- If a pod is selected by at least one network policy, then all traffic is blocked ...

  ... unless it is explicitly allowed by one of these network policies

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Traffic filtering is flow-oriented

- Network policies deal with *connections*, not individual packets

- Example: to allow HTTP (80/tcp) connections to pod A, you only need an ingress rule

  (You do not need a matching egress rule to allow response traffic to go through)

- This also applies for UDP traffic

  (Allowing DNS traffic can be done with a single rule)

- Network policy implementations use stateful connection tracking

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Pod-to-pod traffic

- Connections from pod A to pod B have to be allowed by both pods:

  - pod A has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *egress* rule

  - pod B has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *ingress* rule

- As a consequence: if a network policy restricts traffic going from/to a pod,
  <br/>
  the restriction cannot be overridden by a network policy selecting another pod

- This prevents an entity managing network policies in namespace A
  (but without permission to do so in namespace B)
  from adding network policies giving them access to namespace B

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## The rationale for network policies

- In network security, it is generally considered better to "deny all, then allow selectively"

  (The other approach, "allow all, then block selectively" makes it too easy to leave holes)

- As soon as one network policy selects a pod, the pod enters this "deny all" logic

- Further network policies can open additional access

- Good network policies should be scoped as precisely as possible

- In particular: make sure that the selector is not too broad

  (Otherwise, you end up affecting pods that were otherwise well secured)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Our first network policy

This is our game plan:

- run a web server in a pod

- create a network policy to block all access to the web server

- create another network policy to allow access only from specific pods

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Running our test web server

.exercise[

- Let's use the `nginx` image:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment testweb --image=nginx
  ```

- Find out the IP address of the pod with one of these two commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -l app=testweb
  IP=$(kubectl get pods -l app=testweb -o json | jq -r .items[0].status.podIP)
  ```

- Check that we can connect to the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```
]

The `curl` command should show us the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Adding a very restrictive network policy

- The policy will select pods with the label `app=testweb`

- It will specify an empty list of ingress rules (matching nothing)

.exercise[

- Apply the policy in this YAML file:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-deny-all-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

- Check if we can still access the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

]

The `curl` command should now time out.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-all-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing connections only from specific pods

- We want to allow traffic from pods with the label `run=testcurl`

- Reminder: this label is automatically applied when we do `kubectl run testcurl ...`

.exercise[

- Apply another policy:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-allow-testcurl-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the second file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-testcurl-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: testcurl
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Testing the network policy

- Let's create pods with, and without, the required label

.exercise[

- Try to connect to testweb from a pod with the `run=testcurl` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testcurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

- Try to connect to testweb with a different label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testkurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

]

The first command will work (and show the "Welcome to nginx!" page).

The second command will fail and time out after 3 seconds.

(The timeout is obtained with the `-m3` option.)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## An important warning

- Some network plugins only have partial support for network policies

- For instance, Weave added support for egress rules [in version 2.4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3313) (released in July 2018)

- But only recently added support for ipBlock [in version 2.5](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3367) (released in Nov 2018)

- Unsupported features might be silently ignored

  (Making you believe that you are secure, when you're not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies, pods, and services

- Network policies apply to *pods*

- A *service* can select multiple pods

  (And load balance traffic across them)

- It is possible that we can connect to some pods, but not some others

  (Because of how network policies have been defined for these pods)

- In that case, connections to the service will randomly pass or fail

  (Depending on whether the connection was sent to a pod that we have access to or not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies and namespaces

- A good strategy is to isolate a namespace, so that:

  - all the pods in the namespace can communicate together

  - other namespaces cannot access the pods

  - external access has to be enabled explicitly

- Let's see what this would look like for the DockerCoins app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies for DockerCoins

- We are going to apply two policies

- The first policy will prevent traffic from other namespaces

- The second policy will allow traffic to the `webui` pods

- That's all we need for that app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Blocking traffic from other namespaces

This policy selects all pods in the current namespace.

It allows traffic only from pods in the current namespace.

(An empty `podSelector` means "all pods.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-from-other-namespaces
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing traffic to `webui` pods

This policy selects all pods with label `app=webui`.

It allows traffic from any source.

(An empty `from` field means "all sources.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-webui
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webui
  ingress:
  - from: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Applying both network policies

- Both network policies are declared in the file `k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml`

.exercise[

- Apply the network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml
  ```

- Check that we can still access the web UI from outside
  <br/>
  (and that the app is still working correctly!)

- Check that we can't connect anymore to `rng` or `hasher` through their ClusterIP

]

Note: using `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward` allows us to connect
regardless of existing network policies. This allows us to debug and
troubleshoot easily, without having to poke holes in our firewall.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Cleaning up our network policies

- The network policies that we have installed block all traffic to the default namespace

- We should remove them, otherwise further exercises will fail!

.exercise[

- Remove all network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete networkpolicies --all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Protecting the control plane

- Should we add network policies to block unauthorized access to the control plane?

  (etcd, API server, etc.)

--

- At first, it seems like a good idea ...

--

- But it *shouldn't* be necessary:

  - not all network plugins support network policies

  - the control plane is secured by other methods (mutual TLS, mostly)

  - the code running in our pods can reasonably expect to contact the API
    <br/>
    (and it can do so safely thanks to the API permission model)

- If we block access to the control plane, we might disrupt legitimate code

- ...Without necessarily improving security

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Further resources

- As always, the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is a good starting point

- The API documentation has a lot of detail about the format of various objects:

  - [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicy-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicySpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyspec-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicyIngressRule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyingressrule-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - etc.

- And two resources by [Ahmet Alp Balkan](https://ahmet.im/):

  - a [very good talk about network policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P-3-xqvmWaZbbI1sW-ulZb&v=3gGpMmYeEO8) at KubeCon North America 2017

  - a repository of [ready-to-use recipes](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes) for network policies

# Pod Security Policies

- By default, our pods and containers can do *everything*

  (including taking over the entire cluster)

- We are going to show an example of a malicious pod

- Then we will explain how to avoid this with PodSecurityPolicies

- We will enable PodSecurityPolicies on our cluster

- We will create a couple of policies (restricted and permissive)

- Finally we will see how to use them to improve security on our cluster

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Setting up a namespace

- For simplicity, let's work in a separate namespace

- Let's create a new namespace called "green"

.exercise[

- Create the "green" namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace green
  ```

- Change to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns green
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Creating a basic Deployment

- Just to check that everything works correctly, deploy NGINX

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment using the official NGINX image:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

- Confirm that the Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod exist, and that the Pod is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## One example of malicious pods

- We will now show an escalation technique in action

- We will deploy a DaemonSet that adds our SSH key to the root account

  (on *each* node of the cluster)

- The Pods of the DaemonSet will do so by mounting `/root` from the host

.exercise[

- Check the file `k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml` with a text editor:
  ```bash
  vim ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- If you would like, change the SSH key (by changing the GitHub user name)

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Deploying the malicious pods

- Let's deploy our "exploit"!

.exercise[

- Create the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- Check that the pods are running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- Confirm that the SSH key was added to the node's root account:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Cleaning up

- Before setting up our PodSecurityPolicies, clean up that namespace

.exercise[

- Remove the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete daemonset hacktheplanet
  ```

- Remove the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment web
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies in theory

- To use PSPs, we need to activate their specific *admission controller*

- That admission controller will intercept each pod creation attempt

- It will look at:

  - *who/what* is creating the pod

  - which PodSecurityPolicies they can use

  - which PodSecurityPolicies can be used by the Pod's ServiceAccount

- Then it will compare the Pod with each PodSecurityPolicy one by one

- If a PodSecurityPolicy accepts all the parameters of the Pod, it is created

- Otherwise, the Pod creation is denied and it won't even show up in `kubectl get pods`

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies fine print

- With RBAC, using a PSP corresponds to the verb `use` on the PSP

  (that makes sense, right?)

- If no PSP is defined, no Pod can be created

  (even by cluster admins)

- Pods that are already running are *not* affected

- If we create a Pod directly, it can use a PSP to which *we* have access

- If the Pod is created by e.g. a ReplicaSet or DaemonSet, it's different:

  - the ReplicaSet / DaemonSet controllers don't have access to *our* policies

  - therefore, we need to give access to the PSP to the Pod's ServiceAccount

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies in practice

- We are going to enable the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller

- At that point, we won't be able to create any more pods (!)

- Then we will create a couple of PodSecurityPolicies

- ...And associated ClusterRoles (giving `use` access to the policies)

- Then we will create RoleBindings to grant these roles to ServiceAccounts

- We will verify that we can't run our "exploit" anymore

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Enabling Pod Security Policies

- To enable Pod Security Policies, we need to enable their *admission plugin*

- This is done by adding a flag to the API server

- On clusters deployed with `kubeadm`, the control plane runs in static pods

- These pods are defined in YAML files located in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

- Kubelet watches this directory

- Each time a file is added/removed there, kubelet creates/deletes the corresponding pod

- Updating a file causes the pod to be deleted and recreated

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Updating the API server flags

- Let's edit the manifest for the API server pod

.exercise[

- Have a look at the static pods:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

- Edit the one corresponding to the API server:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Adding the PSP admission plugin

- There should already be a line with `--enable-admission-plugins=...`

- Let's add `PodSecurityPolicy` on that line

.exercise[

- Locate the line with `--enable-admission-plugins=`

- Add `PodSecurityPolicy`

  It should read: `--enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy`

- Save, quit

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Waiting for the API server to restart

- The kubelet detects that the file was modified

- It kills the API server pod, and starts a new one

- During that time, the API server is unavailable

.exercise[

- Wait until the API server is available again

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Check that the admission plugin is active

- Normally, we can't create any Pod at this point

.exercise[

- Try to create a Pod directly:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp1 --image=nginx --restart=Never
  ```

- Try to create a Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp2 --image=nginx
  ```

- Look at existing resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

We can get hints at what's happening by looking at the ReplicaSet and Events.

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Introducing our Pod Security Policies

- We will create two policies:

  - privileged (allows everything)

  - restricted (blocks some unsafe mechanisms)

- For each policy, we also need an associated ClusterRole granting *use*

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Creating our Pod Security Policies

- We have a couple of files, each defining a PSP and associated ClusterRole:

  - k8s/psp-privileged.yaml: policy `privileged`, role `psp:privileged`
  - k8s/psp-restricted.yaml: policy `restricted`, role `psp:restricted`

.exercise[

- Create both policies and their associated ClusterRoles:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/psp-restricted.yaml
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/psp-privileged.yaml
  ```
]

- The privileged policy comes from [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#example-policies)

- The restricted policy is inspired by that same documentation page

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Check that we can create Pods again

- We haven't bound the policy to any user yet

- But `cluster-admin` can implicitly `use` all policies

.exercise[

- Check that we can now create a Pod directly:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp3 --image=nginx --restart=Never
  ```

- Create a Deployment as well:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp4 --image=nginx
  ```

- Confirm that the Deployment is *not* creating any Pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- We can create Pods directly (thanks to our root-like permissions)

- The Pods corresponding to a Deployment are created by the ReplicaSet controller

- The ReplicaSet controller does *not* have root-like permissions

- We need to either:

  - grant permissions to the ReplicaSet controller

  *or*

  - grant permissions to our Pods' ServiceAccount

- The first option would allow *anyone* to create pods

- The second option will allow us to scope the permissions better

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Binding the restricted policy

- Let's bind the role `psp:restricted` to ServiceAccount `green:default`

  (aka the default ServiceAccount in the green Namespace)

- This will allow Pod creation in the green Namespace

  (because these Pods will be using that ServiceAccount automatically)

.exercise[

- Create the following RoleBinding:
  ```bash
    kubectl create rolebinding psp:restricted \
            --clusterrole=psp:restricted \
            --serviceaccount=green:default
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Trying it out

- The Deployments that we created earlier will *eventually* recover

  (the ReplicaSet controller will retry to create Pods once in a while)

- If we create a new Deployment now, it should work immediately

.exercise[

- Create a simple Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment testpsp5 --image=nginx
  ```

- Look at the Pods that have been created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Trying to hack the cluster

- Let's create the same DaemonSet we used earlier

.exercise[

- Create a hostile DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- Look at the state of the namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What's in our restricted policy?

- The restricted PSP is similar to the one provided in the docs, but:

  - it allows containers to run as root

  - it doesn't drop capabilities

- Many containers run as root by default, and would require additional tweaks

- Many containers use e.g. `chown`, which requires a specific capability

  (that's the case for the NGINX official image, for instance)

- We still block: hostPath, privileged containers, and much more!

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The case of static pods

- If we list the pods in the `kube-system` namespace, `kube-apiserver` is missing

- However, the API server is obviously running

  (otherwise, `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system` wouldn't work)

- The API server Pod is created directly by kubelet

  (without going through the PSP admission plugin)

- Then, kubelet creates a "mirror pod" representing that Pod in etcd

- That "mirror pod" creation goes through the PSP admission plugin

- And it gets blocked!

- This can be fixed by binding `psp:privileged` to group `system:nodes`

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## .warning[Before moving on...]

- Our cluster is currently broken

  (we can't create pods in namespaces kube-system, default, ...)

- We need to either:

  - disable the PSP admission plugin

  - allow use of PSP to relevant users and groups

- For instance, we could:

  - bind `psp:restricted` to the group `system:authenticated`

  - bind `psp:privileged` to the ServiceAccount `kube-system:default`

# Resource Limits

- We can attach resource indications to our pods

  (or rather: to the *containers* in our pods)

- We can specify *limits* and/or *requests*

- We can specify quantities of CPU and/or memory

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## CPU vs memory

- CPU is a *compressible resource*

  (it can be preempted immediately without adverse effect)

- Memory is an *incompressible resource*

  (it needs to be swapped out to be reclaimed; and this is costly)

- As a result, exceeding limits will have different consequences for CPU and memory

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Exceeding CPU limits

- CPU can be reclaimed instantaneously

  (in fact, it is preempted hundreds of times per second, at each context switch)

- If a container uses too much CPU, it can be throttled

  (it will be scheduled less often)

- The processes in that container will run slower

  (or rather: they will not run faster)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Exceeding memory limits

- Memory needs to be swapped out before being reclaimed

- "Swapping" means writing memory pages to disk, which is very slow

- On a classic system, a process that swaps can get 1000x slower

  (because disk I/O is 1000x slower than memory I/O)

- Exceeding the memory limit (even by a small amount) can reduce performance *a lot*

- Kubernetes *does not support swap* (more on that later!)

- Exceeding the memory limit will cause the container to be killed



.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limits vs requests

- Limits are "hard limits" (they can't be exceeded)

  - a container exceeding its memory limit is killed

  - a container exceeding its CPU limit is throttled

- Requests are used for scheduling purposes

  - a container using *less* than what it requested will never be killed or throttled

  - the scheduler uses the requested sizes to determine placement

  - the resources requested by all pods on a node will never exceed the node size

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Pod quality of service

Each pod is assigned a QoS class (visible in `status.qosClass`).

- If limits = requests:

  - as long as the container uses less than the limit, it won't be affected

  - if all containers in a pod have *(limits=requests)*, QoS is considered "Guaranteed"

- If requests &lt; limits:

  - as long as the container uses less than the request, it won't be affected

  - otherwise, it might be killed/evicted if the node gets overloaded

  - if at least one container has *(requests&lt;limits)*, QoS is considered "Burstable"

- If a pod doesn't have any request nor limit, QoS is considered "BestEffort"

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Quality of service impact

- When a node is overloaded, BestEffort pods are killed first

- Then, Burstable pods that exceed their limits

- Burstable and Guaranteed pods below their limits are never killed

  (except if their node fails)

- If we only use Guaranteed pods, no pod should ever be killed

  (as long as they stay within their limits)

(Pod QoS is also explained in [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) of the Kubernetes documentation and in [this blog post](https://medium.com/google-cloud/quality-of-service-class-qos-in-kubernetes-bb76a89eb2c6).)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Where is my swap?

- The semantics of memory and swap limits on Linux cgroups are complex

- In particular, it's not possible to disable swap for a cgroup

  (the closest option is to [reduce "swappiness"](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77939/turning-off-swapping-for-only-one-process-with-cgroups))

- The architects of Kubernetes wanted to ensure that Guaranteed pods never swap

- The only solution was to disable swap entirely

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Alternative point of view

- Swap enables paging¬π of anonymous¬≤ memory

- Even when swap is disabled, Linux will still page memory for:

  - executables, libraries

  - mapped files

- Disabling swap *will reduce performance and available resources*

- For a good time, read [kubernetes/kubernetes#53533](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53533)

- Also read this [excellent blog post about swap](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/17/mystery-swap/)

¬πPaging: reading/writing memory pages from/to disk to reclaim physical memory

¬≤Anonymous memory: memory that is not backed by files or blocks

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Enabling swap anyway

- If you don't care that pods are swapping, you can enable swap

- You will need to add the flag `--fail-swap-on=false` to kubelet

  (otherwise, it won't start!)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Specifying resources

- Resource requests are expressed at the *container* level

- CPU is expressed in "virtual CPUs"

  (corresponding to the virtual CPUs offered by some cloud providers)

- CPU can be expressed with a decimal value, or even a "milli" suffix

  (so 100m = 0.1)

- Memory is expressed in bytes

- Memory can be expressed with k, M, G, T, ki, Mi, Gi, Ti suffixes

  (corresponding to 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12, 2^10, 2^20, 2^30, 2^40)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Specifying resources in practice

This is what the spec of a Pod with resources will look like:

```yaml
containers:
- name: httpenv
  image: jpetazzo/httpenv
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: "100Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
    requests:
      memory: "100Mi"
      cpu: "10m"
```

This set of resources makes sure that this service won't be killed (as long as it stays below 100 MB of RAM), but allows its CPU usage to be throttled if necessary.

## Default values

- If we specify a limit without a request: 

  the request is set to the limit

- If we specify a request without a limit: 

  there will be no limit

  (which means that the limit will be the size of the node)

- If we don't specify anything:

  the request is zero and the limit is the size of the node

*Unless there are default values defined for our namespace!*

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## We need default resource values

- If we do not set resource values at all:

  - the limit is "the size of the node"

  - the request is zero

- This is generally *not* what we want

  - a container without a limit can use up all the resources of a node

  - if the request is zero, the scheduler can't make a smart placement decision

- To address this, we can set default values for resources

- This is done with a LimitRange object

# Defining min, max, and default resources

- We can create LimitRange objects to indicate any combination of:

  - min and/or max resources allowed per pod

  - default resource *limits*

  - default resource *requests*

  - maximal burst ratio (*limit/request*)

- LimitRange objects are namespaced

- They apply to their namespace only

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## LimitRange example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: my-very-detailed-limitrange
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    min:
      cpu: "100m"
    max:
      cpu: "2000m"
      memory: "1Gi"
    default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "250Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "500m"
```

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Example explanation

The YAML on the previous slide shows an example LimitRange object specifying very detailed limits on CPU usage,
and providing defaults on RAM usage.

Note the `type: Container` line: in the future,
it might also be possible to specify limits
per Pod, but it's not [officially documented yet](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/9585).

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## LimitRange details

- LimitRange restrictions are enforced only when a Pod is created

  (they don't apply retroactively)

- They don't prevent creation of e.g. an invalid Deployment or DaemonSet

  (but the pods will not be created as long as the LimitRange is in effect)

- If there are multiple LimitRange restrictions, they all apply together

  (which means that it's possible to specify conflicting LimitRanges,
  <br/>preventing any Pod from being created)

- If a LimitRange specifies a `max` for a resource but no `default`,
  <br/>that `max` value becomes the `default` limit too

# Namespace quotas

- We can also set quotas per namespace

- Quotas apply to the total usage in a namespace

  (e.g. total CPU limits of all pods in a given namespace)

- Quotas can apply to resource limits and/or requests

  (like the CPU and memory limits that we saw earlier)

- Quotas can also apply to other resources:

  - "extended" resources (like GPUs)

  - storage size

  - number of objects (number of pods, services...)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Creating a quota for a namespace

- Quotas are enforced by creating a ResourceQuota object

- ResourceQuota objects are namespaced, and apply to their namespace only

- We can have multiple ResourceQuota objects in the same namespace

- The most restrictive values are used

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limiting total CPU/memory usage

- The following YAML specifies an upper bound for *limits* and *requests*:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: a-little-bit-of-compute
    spec:
      hard:
        requests.cpu: "10"
        requests.memory: 10Gi
        limits.cpu: "20"
        limits.memory: 20Gi
  ```

These quotas will apply to the namespace where the ResourceQuota is created.

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limiting number of objects

- The following YAML specifies how many objects of specific types can be created:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: quota-for-objects
    spec:
      hard:
        pods: 100
        services: 10
        secrets: 10
        configmaps: 10
        persistentvolumeclaims: 20
        services.nodeports: 0
        services.loadbalancers: 0
        count/roles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io: 10
  ```

(The `count/` syntax allows limiting arbitrary objects, including CRDs.)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## YAML vs CLI

- Quotas can be created with a YAML definition

- ...Or with the `kubectl create quota` command

- Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl create quota my-resource-quota --hard=pods=300,limits.memory=300Gi
  ```

- With both YAML and CLI form, the values are always under the `hard` section

  (there is no `soft` quota)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Viewing current usage

When a ResourceQuota is created, we can see how much of it is used:

```
kubectl describe resourcequota my-resource-quota

Name:                            my-resource-quota
Namespace:                       default
Resource                         Used  Hard
--------                         ----  ----
pods                             12    100
services                         1     5
services.loadbalancers           0     0
services.nodeports               0     0
```

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Advanced quotas and PriorityClass

- Since Kubernetes 1.12, it is possible to create PriorityClass objects

- Pods can be assigned a PriorityClass

- Quotas can be linked to a PriorityClass

- This allows us to reserve resources for pods within a namespace

- For more details, check [this documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#resource-quota-per-priorityclass)

# Limiting resources in practice

- We have at least three mechanisms:

  - requests and limits per Pod

  - LimitRange per namespace

  - ResourceQuota per namespace

- Let's see a simple recommendation to get started with resource limits

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Set a LimitRange

- In each namespace, create a LimitRange object

- Set a small default CPU request and CPU limit

  (e.g. "100m")

- Set a default memory request and limit depending on your most common workload

  - for Java, Ruby: start with "1G"

  - for Go, Python, PHP, Node: start with "250M"

- Set upper bounds slightly below your expected node size

  (80-90% of your node size, with at least a 500M memory buffer)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Set a ResourceQuota

- In each namespace, create a ResourceQuota object

- Set generous CPU and memory limits

  (e.g. half the cluster size if the cluster hosts multiple apps)

- Set generous objects limits

  - these limits should not be here to constrain your users

  - they should catch a runaway process creating many resources

  - example: a custom controller creating many pods

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Observe, refine, iterate

- Observe the resource usage of your pods

  (we will see how in the next chapter)

- Adjust individual pod limits

- If you see trends: adjust the LimitRange

  (rather than adjusting every individual set of pod limits)

- Observe the resource usage of your namespaces

  (with `kubectl describe resourcequota ...`)

- Rinse and repeat regularly

# Checking pod and node resource usage

- Since Kubernetes 1.8, metrics are collected by the [resource metrics pipeline](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/)

- The resource metrics pipeline is:

  - optional (Kubernetes can function without it)

  - necessary for some features (like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

  - exposed through the Kubernetes API using the [aggregation layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/)

  - usually implemented by the "metrics server"

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## How to know if the metrics server is running?

- The easiest way to know is to run `kubectl top`

.exercise[

- Check if the core metrics pipeline is available:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  ```

]

If it shows our nodes and their CPU and memory load, we're good!

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## Installing metrics server

- The metrics server doesn't have any particular requirements

  (it doesn't need persistence, as it doesn't *store* metrics)

- It has its own repository, [kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server)

- The repository comes with [YAML files for deployment](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/tree/master/deploy/1.8%2B)

- These files may not work on some clusters

  (e.g. if your node names are not in DNS)

- The container.training repository has a [metrics-server.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/k8s/metrics-server.yaml#L90) file to help with that

  (we can `kubectl apply -f` that file if needed)

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## Showing container resource usage

- Once the metrics server is running, we can check container resource usage

.exercise[

- Show resource usage across all containers:
  ```bash
  kubectl top pods --containers --all-namespaces
  ```
]

- We can also use selectors (`-l app=...`)

# Cluster sizing

- What happens when the cluster gets full?

- How can we scale up the cluster?

- Can we do it automatically?

- What are other methods to address capacity planning?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## When are we out of resources?

- kubelet monitors node resources:

  - memory

  - node disk usage (typically the root filesystem of the node)

  - image disk usage (where container images and RW layers are stored)

- For each resource, we can provide two thresholds:

  - a hard threshold (if it's met, it provokes immediate action)

  - a soft threshold (provokes action only after a grace period)

- Resource thresholds and grace periods are configurable

  (by passing kubelet command-line flags)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What happens then?

- If disk usage is too high:

  - kubelet will try to remove terminated pods

  - then, it will try to *evict* pods

- If memory usage is too high:

  - it will try to evict pods

- The node is marked as "under pressure"

- This temporarily prevents new pods from being scheduled on the node

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Which pods get evicted?

- kubelet looks at the pods' QoS and PriorityClass

- First, pods with BestEffort QoS are considered

- Then, pods with Burstable QoS exceeding their *requests*

  (but only if the exceeding resource is the one that is low on the node)

- Finally, pods with Guaranteed QoS, and Burstable pods within their requests

- Within each group, pods are sorted by PriorityClass

- If there are pods with the same PriorityClass, they are sorted by usage excess

  (i.e. the pods whose usage exceeds their requests the most are evicted first)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Eviction of Guaranteed pods

- *Normally*, pods with Guaranteed QoS should not be evicted

- A chunk of resources is reserved for node processes (like kubelet)

- It is expected that these processes won't use more than this reservation

- If they do use more resources anyway, all bets are off!

- If this happens, kubelet must evict Guaranteed pods to preserve node stability

  (or Burstable pods that are still within their requested usage)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What happens to evicted pods?

- The pod is terminated

- It is marked as `Failed` at the API level

- If the pod was created by a controller, the controller will recreate it

- The pod will be recreated on another node, *if there are resources available!*

- For more details about the eviction process, see:

  - [this documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/) about resource pressure and pod eviction,

  - [this other documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/) about pod priority and preemption.

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What if there are no resources available?

- Sometimes, a pod cannot be scheduled anywhere:

  - all the nodes are under pressure,

  - or the pod requests more resources than are available

- The pod then remains in `Pending` state until the situation improves

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Cluster scaling

- One way to improve the situation is to add new nodes

- This can be done automatically with the [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)

- The autoscaler will automatically scale up:

  - if there are pods that failed to be scheduled

- The autoscaler will automatically scale down:

  - if nodes have a low utilization for an extended period of time

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Restrictions, gotchas ...

- The Cluster Autoscaler only supports a few cloud infrastructures

  (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider) for a list)

- The Cluster Autoscaler cannot scale down nodes that have pods using:

  - local storage

  - affinity/anti-affinity rules preventing them from being rescheduled

  - a restrictive PodDisruptionBudget

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Other way to do capacity planning

- "Running Kubernetes without nodes"

- Systems like [Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/) or Kiyot can run pods using on-demand resources

  - Virtual Kubelet can leverage e.g. ACI or Fargate to run pods

  - Kiyot runs pods in ad-hoc EC2 instances (1 instance per pod)

- Economic advantage (no wasted capacity)

- Security advantage (stronger isolation between pods)

Check [this blog post](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2019/02/13/running-kubernetes-without-nodes-with-kiyot/) for more details.

# The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

- What is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, or HPA?

- It is a controller that can perform *horizontal* scaling automatically

- Horizontal scaling = changing the number of replicas

  (adding/removing pods)

- Vertical scaling = changing the size of individual replicas

  (increasing/reducing CPU and RAM per pod)

- Cluster scaling = changing the size of the cluster

  (adding/removing nodes)

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Principle of operation

- Each HPA resource (or "policy") specifies:

  - which object to monitor and scale (e.g. a Deployment, ReplicaSet...)

  - min/max scaling ranges (the max is a safety limit!)

  - a target resource usage (e.g. the default is CPU=80%)

- The HPA continuously monitors the CPU usage for the related object

- It computes how many pods should be running:

  `TargetNumOfPods = ceil(sum(CurrentPodsCPUUtilization) / Target)`

- It scales the related object up/down to this target number of pods

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Pre-requirements

- The metrics server needs to be running

  (i.e. we need to be able to see pod metrics with `kubectl top pods`)

- The pods that we want to autoscale need to have resource requests

  (because the target CPU% is not absolute, but relative to the request)

- The latter actually makes a lot of sense:

  - if a Pod doesn't have a CPU request, it might be using 10% of CPU...

  - ...but only because there is no CPU time available!

  - this makes sure that we won't add pods to nodes that are already resource-starved

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Testing the HPA

- We will start a CPU-intensive web service

- We will send some traffic to that service

- We will create an HPA policy

- The HPA will automatically scale up the service for us

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## A CPU-intensive web service

- Let's use `jpetazzo/busyhttp`

  (it is a web server that will use 1s of CPU for each HTTP request)

.exercise[

- Deploy the web server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment busyhttp --image=jpetazzo/busyhttp
  ```

- Expose it with a ClusterIP service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment busyhttp --port=80
  ```

- Get the ClusterIP allocated to the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc busyhttp
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Monitor what's going on

- Let's start a bunch of commands to watch what is happening

.exercise[

- Monitor pod CPU usage:
  ```bash
  watch kubectl top pods
  ```

- Monitor service latency:
  ```bash
  httping http://`ClusterIP`/
  ```

- Monitor cluster events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Send traffic to the service

- We will use `ab` (Apache Bench) to send traffic

.exercise[

- Send a lot of requests to the service, with a concurrency level of 3:
  ```bash
  ab -c 3 -n 100000 http://`ClusterIP`/
  ```

]

The latency (reported by `httping`) should increase above 3s.

The CPU utilization should increase to 100%.

(The server is single-threaded and won't go above 100%.)

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Create an HPA policy

- There is a helper command to do that for us: `kubectl autoscale`

.exercise[

- Create the HPA policy for the `busyhttp` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl autoscale deployment busyhttp --max=10
  ```

]

By default, it will assume a target of 80% CPU usage.

This can also be set with `--cpu-percent=`.

--

*The autoscaler doesn't seem to work. Why?*

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## What did we miss?

- The events stream gives us a hint, but to be honest, it's not very clear:

  `missing request for cpu`

- We forgot to specify a resource request for our Deployment!

- The HPA target is not an absolute CPU%

- It is relative to the CPU requested by the pod

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Adding a CPU request

- Let's edit the deployment and add a CPU request

- Since our server can use up to 1 core, let's request 1 core

.exercise[

- Edit the Deployment definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit deployment busyhttp
  ```

- In the `containers` list, add the following block:
  ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "1"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Results

- After saving and quitting, a rolling update happens

  (if `ab` or `httping` exits, make sure to restart it)

- It will take a minute or two for the HPA to kick in:

  - the HPA runs every 30 seconds by default

  - it needs to gather metrics from the metrics server first

- If we scale further up (or down), the HPA will react after a few minutes:

  - it won't scale up if it already scaled in the last 3 minutes

  - it won't scale down if it already scaled in the last 5 minutes

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## What about other metrics?

- The HPA in API group `autoscaling/v1` only supports CPU scaling

- The HPA in API group `autoscaling/v2beta2` supports metrics from various API groups:

  - metrics.k8s.io, aka metrics server (per-Pod CPU and RAM)

  - custom.metrics.k8s.io, custom metrics per Pod

  - external.metrics.k8s.io, external metrics (not associated to Pods)

- Kubernetes doesn't implement any of these API groups

- Using these metrics requires [registering additional APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-apis)

- The metrics provided by metrics server are standard; everything else is custom

- For more details, see [this great blog post](https://medium.com/uptime-99/kubernetes-hpa-autoscaling-with-custom-and-external-metrics-da7f41ff7846) or [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSiGFH4ZnS8)

# Collecting metrics with Prometheus

- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system including:

  - multiple *service discovery* backends to figure out which metrics to collect

  - a *scraper* to collect these metrics

  - an efficient *time series database* to store these metrics

  - a specific query language (PromQL) to query these time series

  - an *alert manager* to notify us according to metrics values or trends

- We are going to use it to collect and query some metrics on our Kubernetes cluster

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Why Prometheus?

- We don't endorse Prometheus more or less than any other system

- It's relatively well integrated within the cloud-native ecosystem

- It can be self-hosted (this is useful for tutorials like this)

- It can be used for deployments of varying complexity:

  - one binary and 10 lines of configuration to get started

  - all the way to thousands of nodes and millions of metrics

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Exposing metrics to Prometheus

- Prometheus obtains metrics and their values by querying *exporters*

- An exporter serves metrics over HTTP, in plain text

- This is what the *node exporter* looks like:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics

- Prometheus itself exposes its own internal metrics, too:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9090/metrics

- If you want to expose custom metrics to Prometheus:

  - serve a text page like these, and you're good to go

  - libraries are available in various languages to help with quantiles etc.

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## How Prometheus gets these metrics

- The *Prometheus server* will *scrape* URLs like these at regular intervals

  (by default: every minute; can be more/less frequent)

- If you're worried about parsing overhead: exporters can also use protobuf

- The list of URLs to scrape (the *scrape targets*) is defined in configuration

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Defining scrape targets

This is maybe the simplest configuration file for Prometheus:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

- In this configuration, Prometheus collects its own internal metrics

- A typical configuration file will have multiple `scrape_configs`

- In this configuration, the list of targets is fixed

- A typical configuration file will use dynamic service discovery

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Service discovery

This configuration file will leverage existing DNS `A` records:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - ...
  - job_name: 'node'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['api-backends.dc-paris-2.enix.io']
        type: 'A'
        port: 9100
```

- In this configuration, Prometheus resolves the provided name(s)

  (here, `api-backends.dc-paris-2.enix.io`)

- Each resulting IP address is added as a target on port 9100

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Dynamic service discovery

- In the DNS example, the names are re-resolved at regular intervals

- As DNS records are created/updated/removed, scrape targets change as well

- Existing data (previously collected metrics) is not deleted

- Other service discovery backends work in a similar fashion

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Other service discovery mechanisms

- Prometheus can connect to e.g. a cloud API to list instances

- Or to the Kubernetes API to list nodes, pods, services ...

- Or a service like Consul, Zookeeper, etcd, to list applications

- The resulting configurations files are *way more complex*

  (but don't worry, we won't need to write them ourselves)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Time series database

- We could wonder, "why do we need a specialized database?"

- One metrics data point = metrics ID + timestamp + value

- With a classic SQL or noSQL data store, that's at least 160 bits of data + indexes

- Prometheus is way more efficient, without sacrificing performance

  (it will even be gentler on the I/O subsystem since it needs to write less)

- Would you like to know more? Check this video:

  [Storage in Prometheus 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4YV-9CrawA) by [Goutham V](https://twitter.com/putadent) at DC17EU

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Checking if Prometheus is installed

- Before trying to install Prometheus, let's check if it's already there

.exercise[

- Look for services with a label `app=prometheus` across all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services --selector=app=prometheus --all-namespaces
  ```

]

If we see a `NodePort` service called `prometheus-server`, we're good!

(We can then skip to "Connecting to the Prometheus web UI".)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Running Prometheus on our cluster

We need to:

- Run the Prometheus server in a pod

  (using e.g. a Deployment to ensure that it keeps running)

- Expose the Prometheus server web UI (e.g. with a NodePort)

- Run the *node exporter* on each node (with a Daemon Set)

- Set up a Service Account so that Prometheus can query the Kubernetes API

- Configure the Prometheus server

  (storing the configuration in a Config Map for easy updates)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Helm charts to the rescue

- To make our lives easier, we are going to use a Helm chart

- The Helm chart will take care of all the steps explained above

  (including some extra features that we don't need, but won't hurt)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Step 1: install Helm

- If we already installed Helm earlier, these commands won't break anything

.exercice[

- Install Tiller (Helm's server-side component) on our cluster:
  ```bash
  helm init
  ```

- Give Tiller permission to deploy things on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Step 2: install Prometheus

- Skip this if we already installed Prometheus earlier

  (in doubt, check with `helm list`)

.exercice[

- Install Prometheus on our cluster:
  ```bash
    helm upgrade prometheus stable/prometheus \
        --install \
        --namespace kube-system \
        --set server.service.type=NodePort \
        --set server.service.nodePort=30090 \
        --set server.persistentVolume.enabled=false \
        --set alertmanager.enabled=false
  ```

]

Curious about all these flags? They're explained in the next slide.

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Explaining all the Helm flags

- `helm upgrade prometheus` ‚Üí upgrade release "prometheus" to the latest version...

  (a "release" is a unique name given to an app deployed with Helm)

- `stable/prometheus` ‚Üí ... of the chart `prometheus` in repo `stable`

- `--install` ‚Üí if the app doesn't exist, create it

- `--namespace kube-system` ‚Üí put it in that specific namespace

- And set the following *values* when rendering the chart's templates:

  - `server.service.type=NodePort` ‚Üí expose the Prometheus server with a NodePort
  - `server.service.nodePort=30090` ‚Üí set the specific NodePort number to use
  - `server.persistentVolume.enabled=false` ‚Üí do not use a PersistentVolumeClaim
  - `alertmanager.enabled=false` ‚Üí disable the alert manager entirely

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Connecting to the Prometheus web UI

- Let's connect to the web UI and see what we can do

.exercise[

- Figure out the NodePort that was allocated to the Prometheus server:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc --all-namespaces | grep prometheus-server
  ```

- With your browser, connect to that port

]

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Querying some metrics

- This is easy... if you are familiar with PromQL

.exercise[

- Click on "Graph", and in "expression", paste the following:
  ```
    sum by (instance) (
      irate(
        container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
          pod_name=~"worker.*"
          }[5m]
      )
    )
  ```

]

- Click on the blue "Execute" button and on the "Graph" tab just below

- We see the cumulated CPU usage of worker pods for each node
  <br/>
  (if we just deployed Prometheus, there won't be much data to see, though)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Getting started with PromQL

- We can't learn PromQL in just 5 minutes

- But we can cover the basics to get an idea of what is possible

  (and have some keywords and pointers)

- We are going to break down the query above

  (building it one step at a time)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Graphing one metric across all tags

This query will show us CPU usage across all containers:
```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total
```

- The suffix of the metrics name tells us:

  - the unit (seconds of CPU)

  - that it's the total used since the container creation

- Since it's a "total," it is an increasing quantity

  (we need to compute the derivative if we want e.g. CPU % over time)

- We see that the metrics retrieved have *tags* attached to them

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Selecting metrics with tags

This query will show us only metrics for worker containers:
```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}
```

- The `=~` operator allows regex matching

- We select all the pods with a name starting with `worker`

  (it would be better to use labels to select pods; more on that later)

- The result is a smaller set of containers

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Transforming counters in rates

This query will show us CPU usage % instead of total seconds used:
```
100*irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}[5m])
```

- The [`irate`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#irate) operator computes the "per-second instant rate of increase"

  - `rate` is similar but allows decreasing counters and negative values

  - with `irate`, if a counter goes back to zero, we don't get a negative spike

- The `[5m]` tells how far to look back if there is a gap in the data

- And we multiply with `100*` to get CPU % usage

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Aggregation operators

This query sums the CPU usage per node:
```
sum by (instance) (
  irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}[5m])
)
```

- `instance` corresponds to the node on which the container is running

- `sum by (instance) (...)` computes the sum for each instance

- Note: all the other tags are collapsed

  (in other words, the resulting graph only shows the `instance` tag)

- PromQL supports many more [aggregation operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## What kind of metrics can we collect?

- Node metrics (related to physical or virtual machines)

- Container metrics (resource usage per container)

- Databases, message queues, load balancers, ...

  (check out this [list of exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)!)

- Instrumentation (=deluxe `printf` for our code)

- Business metrics (customers served, revenue, ...)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Node metrics

- CPU, RAM, disk usage on the whole node

- Total number of processes running, and their states

- Number of open files, sockets, and their states

- I/O activity (disk, network), per operation or volume

- Physical/hardware (when applicable): temperature, fan speed...

- ...and much more!

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Container metrics

- Similar to node metrics, but not totally identical

- RAM breakdown will be different

  - active vs inactive memory
  - some memory is *shared* between containers, and specially accounted for

- I/O activity is also harder to track

  - async writes can cause deferred "charges"
  - some page-ins are also shared between containers

For details about container metrics, see:
<br/>
http://jpetazzo.github.io/2013/10/08/docker-containers-metrics/

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Application metrics

- Arbitrary metrics related to your application and business

- System performance: request latency, error rate...

- Volume information: number of rows in database, message queue size...

- Business data: inventory, items sold, revenue...

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Detecting scrape targets

- Prometheus can leverage Kubernetes service discovery

  (with proper configuration)

- Services or pods can be annotated with:

  - `prometheus.io/scrape: true` to enable scraping
  - `prometheus.io/port: 9090` to indicate the port number
  - `prometheus.io/path: /metrics` to indicate the URI (`/metrics` by default)

- Prometheus will detect and scrape these (without needing a restart or reload)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Querying labels

- What if we want to get metrics for containers belonging to a pod tagged `worker`?

- The cAdvisor exporter does not give us Kubernetes labels

- Kubernetes labels are exposed through another exporter

- We can see Kubernetes labels through metrics `kube_pod_labels`

  (each container appears as a time series with constant value of `1`)

- Prometheus *kind of* supports "joins" between time series

- But only if the names of the tags match exactly

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Unfortunately ...

- The cAdvisor exporter uses tag `pod_name` for the name of a pod

- The Kubernetes service endpoints exporter uses tag `pod` instead

- See [this blog post](https://www.robustperception.io/exposing-the-software-version-to-prometheus) or [this other one](https://www.weave.works/blog/aggregating-pod-resource-cpu-memory-usage-arbitrary-labels-prometheus/) to see how to perform "joins"

- Alas, Prometheus cannot "join" time series with different labels

  (see [Prometheus issue #2204](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2204) for the rationale)

- There is a workaround involving relabeling, but it's "not cheap"

  - see [this comment](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2204#issuecomment-261515520) for an overview

  - or [this blog post](https://5pi.de/2017/11/09/use-prometheus-vector-matching-to-get-kubernetes-utilization-across-any-pod-label/) for a complete description of the process

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## In practice

- Grafana is a beautiful (and useful) frontend to display all kinds of graphs

- Not everyone needs to know Prometheus, PromQL, Grafana, etc.

- But in a team, it is valuable to have at least one person who know them

- That person can set up queries and dashboards for the rest of the team

- It's a little bit like knowing how to optimize SQL queries, Dockerfiles...

  Don't panic if you don't know these tools!

  ...But make sure at least one person in your team is on it üíØ

# Extending the Kubernetes API

There are multiple ways to extend the Kubernetes API.

We are going to cover:

- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- Admission Webhooks

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Revisiting the API server

- The Kubernetes API server is a central point of the control plane

  (everything connects to it: controller manager, scheduler, kubelets)

- Almost everything in Kubernetes is materialized by a resource

- Resources have a type (or "kind")

  (similar to strongly typed languages)

- We can see existing types with `kubectl api-resources`

- We can list resources of a given type with `kubectl get <type>`

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Creating new types

- We can create new types with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- CRDs are created dynamically

  (without recompiling or restarting the API server)

- CRDs themselves are resources:

  - we can create a new type with `kubectl create` and some YAML

  - we can see all our custom types with `kubectl get crds`

- After we create a CRD, the new type works just like built-in types

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## What can we do with CRDs?

There are many possibilities!

- *Operators* encapsulate complex sets of resources

  (e.g.: a PostgreSQL replicated cluster; an etcd cluster...
  <br/>
  see [awesome operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/awesome-operators) and
  [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/) to find more)

- Custom use-cases like [gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/)

  - creates a new custom type, `Remote`, exposing a git+ssh server

  - deploy by pushing YAML or Helm charts to that remote

- Replacing built-in types with CRDs

  (see [this lightning talk by Tim Hockin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji0FWzFwNhA&index=2&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PZf9eA7bhWnIh_mK1vyOfU))

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Little details

- By default, CRDs are not *validated*

  (we can put anything we want in the `spec`)

- When creating a CRD, we can pass an OpenAPI v3 schema (BETA!)

  (which will then be used to validate resources)

- Generally, when creating a CRD, we also want to run a *controller*

  (otherwise nothing will happen when we create resources of that type) 

- The controller will typically *watch* our custom resources

  (and take action when they are created/updated)

*
Examples:
[YAML to install the gitkube CRD](https://storage.googleapis.com/gitkube/gitkube-setup-stable.yaml),
[YAML to install a redis operator CRD](https://github.com/amaizfinance/redis-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/k8s_v1alpha1_redis_crd.yaml)
*

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Service catalog

- *Service catalog* is another extension mechanism

- It's not extending the Kubernetes API strictly speaking

  (but it still provides new features!)

- It doesn't create new types; it uses:

  - ClusterServiceBroker
  - ClusterServiceClass
  - ClusterServicePlan
  - ServiceInstance
  - ServiceBinding 

- It uses the Open service broker API

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission controllers

- When a Pod is created, it is associated with a ServiceAccount

  (even if we did not specify one explicitly)

- That ServiceAccount was added on the fly by an *admission controller*

  (specifically, a *mutating admission controller*)

- Admission controllers sit on the API request path

  (see the cool diagram on next slide, courtesy of Banzai Cloud)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission controllers

- *Validating* admission controllers can accept/reject the API call

- *Mutating* admission controllers can modify the API request payload

- Both types can also trigger additional actions

  (e.g. automatically create a Namespace if it doesn't exist)

- There are a number of built-in admission controllers

  (see [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do) for a list)

- But we can also define our own!

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission Webhooks

- We can setup *admission webhooks* to extend the behavior of the API server

- The API server will submit incoming API requests to these webhooks

- These webhooks can be *validating* or *mutating*

- Webhooks can be set up dynamically (without restarting the API server)

- To setup a dynamic admission webhook, we create a special resource:

  a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` or a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`

- These resources are created and managed like other resources

  (i.e. `kubectl create`, `kubectl get`...)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Webhook Configuration

- A ValidatingWebhookConfiguration or MutatingWebhookConfiguration contains:

  - the address of the webhook

  - the authentication information to use with the webhook

  - a list of rules

- The rules indicate for which objects and actions the webhook is triggered

  (to avoid e.g. triggering webhooks when setting up webhooks)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## (Ab)using the API server

- If we need to store something "safely" (as in: in etcd), we can use CRDs

- This gives us primitives to read/write/list objects (and optionally validate them)

- The Kubernetes API server can run on its own

  (without the scheduler, controller manager, and kubelets)

- By loading CRDs, we can have it manage totally different objects

  (unrelated to containers, clusters, etc.)

# Operators

- Operators are one of the many ways to extend Kubernetes

- We will define operators

- We will see how they work

- We will install a specific operator (for ElasticSearch)

- We will use it to provision an ElasticSearch cluster

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## What are operators?

*An operator represents **human operational knowledge in software,**
<br/>
to reliably manage an application.
‚Äî [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)*

Examples:

- Deploying and configuring replication with MySQL, PostgreSQL ...

- Setting up Elasticsearch, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper ...

- Reacting to failures when intervention is needed

- Scaling up and down these systems

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## What are they made from?

- Operators combine two things:

  - Custom Resource Definitions

  - controller code watching the corresponding resources and acting upon them

- A given operator can define one or multiple CRDs

- The controller code (control loop) typically runs within the cluster

  (running as a Deployment with 1 replica is a common scenario)

- But it could also run elsewhere

  (nothing mandates that the code run on the cluster, as long as it has API access)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Why use operators?

- Kubernetes gives us Deployments, StatefulSets, Services ...

- These mechanisms give us building blocks to deploy applications

- They work great for services that are made of *N* identical containers

  (like stateless ones)

- They also work great for some stateful applications like Consul, etcd ...

  (with the help of highly persistent volumes)

- They're not enough for complex services:

  - where different containers have different roles

  - where extra steps have to be taken when scaling or replacing containers

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Use-cases for operators

- Systems with primary/secondary replication

  Examples: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis ...

- Systems where different groups of nodes have different roles

  Examples: ElasticSearch, MongoDB ...

- Systems with complex dependencies (that are themselves managed with operators)

  Examples: Flink or Kafka, which both depend on Zookeeper

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## More use-cases

- Representing and managing external resources

  (Example: [AWS Service Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/alpha/aws-service-operator.v0.0.1))

- Managing complex cluster add-ons

  (Example: [Istio operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/beta/istio-operator.0.1.6))

- Deploying and managing our applications' lifecycles

  (more on that later)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## How operators work

- An operator creates one or more CRDs

  (i.e., it creates new "Kinds" of resources on our cluster)

- The operator also runs a *controller* that will watch its resources

- Each time we create/update/delete a resource, the controller is notified

  (we could write our own cheap controller with `kubectl get --watch`)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## One operator in action

- We will install the UPMC Enterprises ElasticSearch operator

- This operator requires PersistentVolumes

- We will install Rancher's [local path storage provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) to automatically create these

- Then, we will create an ElasticSearch resource

- The operator will detect that resource and provision the cluster

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Installing a Persistent Volume provisioner

(This step can be skipped if you already have a dynamic volume provisioner.)

- This provisioner creates Persistent Volumes backed by `hostPath`

  (local directories on our nodes)

- It doesn't require anything special ...

- ... But losing a node = losing the volumes on that node!

.exercise[

- Install the local path storage provisioner:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/local-path-storage.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Making sure we have a default StorageClass

- The ElasticSearch operator will create StatefulSets

- These StatefulSets will instantiate PersistentVolumeClaims

- These PVCs need to be explicitly associated with a StorageClass

- Or we need to tag a StorageClass to be used as the default one

.exercise[

- List StorageClasses:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

]

We should see the `local-path` StorageClass.

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Setting a default StorageClass

- This is done by adding an annotation to the StorageClass:

  `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true`

.exercise[

- Tag the StorageClass so that it's the default one:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate storageclass local-path \
            storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

]

Now, the StorageClass should have `(default)` next to its name.

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Install the ElasticSearch operator

- The operator needs:

  - a Deployment for its controller
  - a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding for permissions
  - a Namespace

- We have grouped all the definitions for these resources in a YAML file

.exercise[

- Install the operator:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-operator.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Wait for the operator to be ready

- Some operators require to create their CRDs separately

- This operator will create its CRD itself

  (i.e. the CRD is not listed in the YAML that we applied earlier)

.exercise[

- Wait until the `elasticsearchclusters` CRD shows up:
  ```bash
  kubectl get crds
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Create an ElasticSearch resource

- We can now create a resource with `kind: ElasticsearchCluster`

- The YAML for that resource will specify all the desired parameters:

  - how many nodes do we want of each type (client, master, data)
  - image to use
  - add-ons (kibana, cerebro, ...)
  - whether to use TLS or not
  - etc.

.exercise[

- Create our ElasticSearch cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-cluster.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Operator in action

- Over the next minutes, the operator will create:

  - StatefulSets (one for master nodes, one for data nodes)

  - Deployments (for client nodes; and for add-ons like cerebro and kibana)

  - Services (for all these pods)

.exercise[

- Wait for all the StatefulSets to be fully up and running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulsets -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Connecting to our cluster

- Since connecting directly to the ElasticSearch API is a bit raw,
  <br/>we'll connect to the cerebro frontend instead

.exercise[

- Edit the cerebro service to change its type from ClusterIP to NodePort:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch svc cerebro-es -p "spec: { type: NodePort }"
  ```

- Retrieve the NodePort that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc cerebro-es
  ```

- Connect to that port with a browser

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## (Bonus) Setup filebeat

- Let's send some data to our brand new ElasticSearch cluster!

- We'll deploy a filebeat DaemonSet to collect node logs

.exercise[

- Deploy filebeat:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/filebeat.yaml
  ```

]

We should see at least one index being created in cerebro.

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## (Bonus) Access log data with kibana

- Let's expose kibana (by making kibana-es a NodePort too)

- Then access kibana

- We'll need to configure kibana indexes

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Deploying our apps with operators

- It is very simple to deploy with `kubectl run` / `kubectl expose`

- We can unlock more features by writing YAML and using `kubectl apply`

- Kustomize or Helm let us deploy in multiple environments

  (and adjust/tweak parameters in each environment)

- We can also use an operator to deploy our application

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Pros and cons of deploying with operators

- The app definition and configuration is persisted in the Kubernetes API

- Multiple instances of the app can be manipulated with `kubectl get`

- We can add labels, annotations to the app instances

- Our controller can execute custom code for any lifecycle event

- However, we need to write this controller

- We need to be careful about changes

  (what happens when the resource `spec` is updated?)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Operators are not magic

- Look at the ElasticSearch resource definition

  (`~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-cluster.yaml`)

- What should happen if we flip the `use-tls` flag? Twice?

- What should happen if we remove / re-add the kibana or cerebro sections?

- What should happen if we change the number of nodes?

- What if we want different images or parameters for the different nodes?

*Operators can be very powerful.
<br/>
But we need to know exactly the scenarios that they can handle.*

# What's next?

- Congratulations!

- We learned a lot about Kubernetes, its internals, its advanced concepts

--

- That was just the easy part

- The hard challenges will revolve around *culture* and *people*

--

- ... What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]

## Running an app involves many steps

- Write the app

- Tests, QA ...

- Ship *something* (more on that later)

- Provision resources (e.g. VMs, clusters)

- Deploy the *something* on the resources

- Manage, maintain, monitor the resources

- Manage, maintain, monitor the app

- And much more

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Who does what?

- The old "devs vs ops" division has changed

- In some organizations, "ops" are now called "SRE" or "platform" teams

  (and they have very different sets of skills)

- Do you know which team is responsible for each item on the list on the previous page?

- Acknowledge that a lot of tasks are outsourced

  (e.g. if we add "buy/rack/provision machines" in that list)

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## What do we ship?

- Some organizations embrace "you build it, you run it"

- When "build" and "run" are owned by different teams, where's the line?

- What does the "build" team ship to the "run" team?

- Let's see a few options, and what they imply

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Shipping code

- Team "build" ships code

  (hopefully in a repository, identified by a commit hash)

- Team "run" containerizes that code

‚úîÔ∏è no extra work for developers

‚ùå very little advantage of using containers

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Shipping container images

- Team "build" ships container images

  (hopefully built automatically from a source repository)

- Team "run" uses theses images to create e.g. Kubernetes resources

‚úîÔ∏è universal artefact (support all languages uniformly)

‚úîÔ∏è easy to start a single component (good for monoliths)

‚ùå complex applications will require a lot of extra work

‚ùå adding/removing components in the stack also requires extra work

‚ùå complex applications will run very differently between dev and prod

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Shipping Compose files

(Or another kind of dev-centric manifest)

- Team "build" ships a manifest that works on a single node

  (as well as images, or ways to build them)

- Team "run" adapts that manifest to work on a cluster

‚úîÔ∏è all teams can start the stack in a reliable, deterministic manner

‚ùå adding/removing components still requires *some* work (but less than before)

‚ùå there will be *some* differences between dev and prod

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Shipping Kubernetes manifests

- Team "build" ships ready-to-run manifests

  (YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize ...)

- Team "run" adjusts some parameters and monitors the application

‚úîÔ∏è parity between dev and prod environments

‚úîÔ∏è "run" team can focus on SLAs, SLOs, and overall quality

‚ùå requires *a lot* of extra work (and new skills) from the "build" team

‚ùå Kubernetes is not a very convenient development platform (at least, not yet)

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## What's the right answer?

- It depends on our teams

  - existing skills (do they know how to do it?)

  - availability (do they have the time to do it?)

  - potential skills (can they learn to do it?)

- It depends on our culture

  - owning "run" often implies being on call

  - do we reward on-call duty without encouraging hero syndrome?

  - do we give people resources (time, money) to learn?

## Tools to develop on Kubernetes

*If we decide to make Kubernetes the primary development platform, here
are a few tools that can help us.*

- Docker Desktop

- Draft

- Minikube

- Skaffold

- Tilt

- ...

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Where do we run?

- Managed vs. self-hosted

- Cloud vs. on-premises

- If cloud: public vs. private

- Which vendor/distribution to pick?

- Which versions/features to enable?

.debug[[k8s/lastwords-admin.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/lastwords-admin.md)]
---

## Some guidelines

- Start small

- Outsource what we don't know

- Start simple, and stay simple as long as possible

  (try to stay away from complex features that we don't need)

- Automate

  (regularly check that we can successfully redeploy by following scripts)

- Transfer knowledge

  (make sure everyone is on the same page/level)

- Iterate!

# Volumes

- Volumes are special directories that are mounted in containers

- Volumes can have many different purposes:

  - share files and directories between containers running on the same machine

  - share files and directories between containers and their host

  - centralize configuration information in Kubernetes and expose it to containers

  - manage credentials and secrets and expose them securely to containers

  - store persistent data for stateful services

  - access storage systems (like Ceph, EBS, NFS, Portworx, and many others)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Kubernetes volumes vs. Docker volumes

- Kubernetes and Docker volumes are very similar

  (the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) says otherwise ...
  <br/>
  but it refers to Docker 1.7, which was released in 2015!)

- Docker volumes allow us to share data between containers running on the same host

- Kubernetes volumes allow us to share data between containers in the same pod

- Both Docker and Kubernetes volumes enable access to storage systems

- Kubernetes volumes are also used to expose configuration and secrets

- Docker has specific concepts for configuration and secrets
  <br/>
  (but under the hood, the technical implementation is similar)

- If you're not familiar with Docker volumes, you can safely ignore this slide!

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes ‚â† Persistent Volumes

- Volumes and Persistent Volumes are related, but very different!

- *Volumes*:

  - appear in Pod specifications (see next slide)

  - do not exist as API resources (**cannot** do `kubectl get volumes`)

- *Persistent Volumes*:

  - are API resources (**can** do `kubectl get persistentvolumes`)

  - correspond to concrete volumes (e.g. on a SAN, EBS, etc.)

  - cannot be associated with a Pod directly; but through a Persistent Volume Claim

  - won't be discussed further in this section

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## A simple volume example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-volume
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## A simple volume example, explained

- We define a standalone `Pod` named `nginx-with-volume`

- In that pod, there is a volume named `www`

- No type is specified, so it will default to `emptyDir`

  (as the name implies, it will be initialized as an empty directory at pod creation)

- In that pod, there is also a container named `nginx`

- That container mounts the volume `www` to path `/usr/share/nginx/html/`

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## A volume shared between two containers

.small[
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-volume
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
  - name: git
    image: alpine
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "apk add --no-cache git && git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife /www" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /www/
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a volume, explained

- We added another container to the pod

- That container mounts the `www` volume on a different path (`/www`)

- It uses the `alpine` image

- When started, it installs `git` and clones the `octocat/Spoon-Knife` repository

  (that repository contains a tiny HTML website)

- As a result, NGINX now serves this website

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a volume, in action

- Let's try it!

.exercise[

- Create the pod by applying the YAML file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-with-volume.yaml
  ```

- Check the IP address that was allocated to our pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

- Access the web server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## The devil is in the details

- The default `restartPolicy` is `Always`

- This would cause our `git` container to run again ... and again ... and again

  (with an exponential back-off delay, as explained [in the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy))

- That's why we specified `restartPolicy: OnFailure`

- There is a short period of time during which the website is not available

  (because the `git` container hasn't done its job yet)

- This could be avoided by using [Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)

  (we will see a live example in a few sections)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volume lifecycle

- The lifecycle of a volume is linked to the pod's lifecycle

- This means that a volume is created when the pod is created

- This is mostly relevant for `emptyDir` volumes

  (other volumes, like remote storage, are not "created" but rather "attached" )

- A volume survives across container restarts

- A volume is destroyed (or, for remote storage, detached) when the pod is destroyed

# Managing configuration

- Some applications need to be configured (obviously!)

- There are many ways for our code to pick up configuration:

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - configuration files

  - configuration servers (getting configuration from a database, an API...)

  - ... and more (because programmers can be very creative!)

- How can we do these things with containers and Kubernetes?

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing configuration to containers

- There are many ways to pass configuration to code running in a container:

  - baking it into a custom image

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - injecting configuration files

  - exposing it over the Kubernetes API

  - configuration servers

- Let's review these different strategies!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Baking custom images

- Put the configuration in the image

  (it can be in a configuration file, but also `ENV` or `CMD` actions)

- It's easy! It's simple!

- Unfortunately, it also has downsides:

  - multiplication of images

  - different images for dev, staging, prod ...

  - minor reconfigurations require a whole build/push/pull cycle

- Avoid doing it unless you don't have the time to figure out other options

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments

- Pass options to `args` array in the container specification

- Example ([source](https://github.com/coreos/pods/blob/master/kubernetes.yaml#L29)): 
  ```yaml
      args: 
        - "--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd"
        - "--advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-peer-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2380"
        - "--name=etcd"
  ```

- The options can be passed directly to the program that we run ...

  ... or to a wrapper script that will use them to e.g. generate a config file

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments, pros & cons

- Works great when options are passed directly to the running program

  (otherwise, a wrapper script can work around the issue)

- Works great when there aren't too many parameters

  (to avoid a 20-lines `args` array)

- Requires documentation and/or understanding of the underlying program

  ("which parameters and flags do I need, again?")

- Well-suited for mandatory parameters (without default values)

- Not ideal when we need to pass a real configuration file anyway

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables

- Pass options through the `env` map in the container specification

- Example:
  ```yaml
      env:
      - name: ADMIN_PORT
        value: "8080"
      - name: ADMIN_AUTH
        value: Basic
      - name: ADMIN_CRED
        value: "admin:0pensesame!"
  ```

.warning[`value` must be a string! Make sure that numbers and fancy strings are quoted.]

ü§î Why this weird `{name: xxx, value: yyy}` scheme? It will be revealed soon!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## The downward API

- In the previous example, environment variables have fixed values

- We can also use a mechanism called the *downward API*

- The downward API allows exposing pod or container information

  - either through special files (we won't show that for now)

  - or through environment variables

- The value of these environment variables is computed when the container is started

- Remember: environment variables won't (can't) change after container start

- Let's see a few concrete examples!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's namespace

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

- Useful to generate FQDN of services

  (in some contexts, a short name is not enough)

- For instance, the two commands should be equivalent:
  ```
  curl api-backend
  curl api-backend.$MY_POD_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's IP address

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- Useful if we need to know our IP address

  (we could also read it from `eth0`, but this is more solid)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the container's resource limits

```yaml
    - name: MY_MEM_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test-container
          resource: limits.memory
```

- Useful for runtimes where memory is garbage collected

- Example: the JVM

  (the memory available to the JVM should be set with the `-Xmx ` flag)

- Best practice: set a memory limit, and pass it to the runtime

  (see [this blog post](https://very-serio.us/2017/12/05/running-jvms-in-kubernetes/) for a detailed example)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## More about the downward API

- [This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/) tells more about these environment variables

- And [this one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) explains the other way to use the downward API

  (through files that get created in the container filesystem)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables, pros and cons

- Works great when the running program expects these variables

- Works great for optional parameters with reasonable defaults

  (since the container image can provide these defaults)

- Sort of auto-documented

  (we can see which environment variables are defined in the image, and their values)

- Can be (ab)used with longer values ...

- ... You *can* put an entire Tomcat configuration file in an environment ...

- ... But *should* you?

(Do it if you really need to, we're not judging! But we'll see better ways.)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Injecting configuration files

- Sometimes, there is no way around it: we need to inject a full config file

- Kubernetes provides a mechanism for that purpose: `configmaps`

- A configmap is a Kubernetes resource that exists in a namespace

- Conceptually, it's a key/value map

  (values are arbitrary strings)

- We can think about them in (at least) two different ways:

  - as holding entire configuration file(s)

  - as holding individual configuration parameters

*Note: to hold sensitive information, we can use "Secrets", which
are another type of resource behaving very much like configmaps.
We'll cover them just after!*

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing entire files

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a configuration file

- Key = name of the file

- Value = content of the file

- There can be one key/value pair, or as many as necessary

  (for complex apps with multiple configuration files)

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf"
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf" but another file
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf=app-prod.conf
  # Create a configmap with multiple keys (one per file in the config.d directory)
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=config.d/
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing individual parameters

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a parameter

- Key = name of the parameter

- Value = value of the parameter

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with two keys
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-literal=foreground=red \
      --from-literal=background=blue
  
  # Create a configmap from a file containing key=val pairs
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-env-file=app.conf
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing configmaps to containers

- Configmaps can be exposed as plain files in the filesystem of a container

  - this is achieved by declaring a volume and mounting it in the container

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing whole files

- Configmaps can be exposed as environment variables in the container

  - this is achieved with the downward API

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing individual parameters

- Let's see how to do both!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing a configuration file with a configmap

- We will start a load balancer powered by HAProxy

- We will use the [official `haproxy` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy/)

- It expects to find its configuration in `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

- We will provide a simple HAproxy configuration, `k8s/haproxy.cfg`

- It listens on port 80, and load balances connections between IBM and Google

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.exercise[

- Go to the `k8s` directory in the repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/k8s
  ```

- Create a configmap named `haproxy` and holding the configuration file:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap haproxy --from-file=haproxy.cfg
  ```

- Check what our configmap looks like:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap haproxy -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

We are going to use the following pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: haproxy
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: haproxy
  containers:
  - name: haproxy
    image: haproxy
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config
      mountPath: /usr/local/etc/haproxy/
```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

- The resource definition from the previous slide is in `k8s/haproxy.yaml`

.exercise[

- Create the HAProxy pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/haproxy.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod haproxy --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod haproxy -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod haproxy -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Testing our load balancer

- The load balancer will send:

  - half of the connections to Google

  - the other half to IBM

.exercise[

- Access the load balancer a few times:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  ```

]

We should see connections served by Google, and others served by IBM.

(Each server sends us a redirect page. Look at the URL that they send us to!)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing configmaps with the downward API

- We are going to run a Docker registry on a custom port

- By default, the registry listens on port 5000

- This can be changed by setting environment variable `REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR`

- We are going to store the port number in a configmap

- Then we will expose that configmap as a container environment variable

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.exercise[

- Our configmap will have a single key, `http.addr`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap registry --from-literal=http.addr=0.0.0.0:80
  ```

- Check our configmap:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap registry -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

We are going to use the following pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: registry
spec:
  containers:
  - name: registry
    image: registry
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: registry
          key: http.addr
```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

- The resource definition from the previous slide is in `k8s/registry.yaml`

.exercise[

- Create the registry pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/registry.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod registry --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod registry -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod registry -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

- Confirm that the registry is available on port 80:
  ```bash
  curl $IP/v2/_catalog
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passwords, tokens, sensitive information

- For sensitive information, there is another special resource: *Secrets*

- Secrets and Configmaps work almost the same way

  (we'll expose the differences on the next slide)

- The *intent* is different, though:

  *"You should use secrets for things which are actually secret like API keys, 
  credentials, etc., and use config map for not-secret configuration data."*

  *"In the future there will likely be some differentiators for secrets like rotation or support for backing the secret API w/ HSMs, etc."*

  (Source: [the author of both features](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36925553/580281
))

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Differences between configmaps and secrets
 
- Secrets are base64-encoded when shown with `kubectl get secrets -o yaml`

  - keep in mind that this is just *encoding*, not *encryption*

  - it is very easy to [automatically extract and decode secrets](https://medium.com/@mveritym/decoding-kubernetes-secrets-60deed7a96a3)

- [Secrets can be encrypted at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

- With RBAC, we can authorize a user to access configmaps, but not secrets

  (since they are two different kinds of resources)

# Stateful sets

- Stateful sets are a type of resource in the Kubernetes API

  (like pods, deployments, services...)

- They offer mechanisms to deploy scaled stateful applications

- At a first glance, they look like *deployments*:

  - a stateful set defines a pod spec and a number of replicas *R*

  - it will make sure that *R* copies of the pod are running

  - that number can be changed while the stateful set is running

  - updating the pod spec will cause a rolling update to happen

- But they also have some significant differences

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful sets unique features

- Pods in a stateful set are numbered (from 0 to *R-1*) and ordered

- They are started and updated in order (from 0 to *R-1*)

- A pod is started (or updated) only when the previous one is ready

- They are stopped in reverse order (from *R-1* to 0)

- Each pod know its identity (i.e. which number it is in the set)

- Each pod can discover the IP address of the others easily

- The pods can persist data on attached volumes

ü§î Wait a minute ... Can't we already attach volumes to pods and deployments?

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Revisiting volumes

- [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) are used for many purposes:

  - sharing data between containers in a pod

  - exposing configuration information and secrets to containers

  - accessing storage systems

- Let's see examples of the latter usage

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Volumes types

- There are many [types of volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes) available:

  - public cloud storage (GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, AzureDisk...)

  - private cloud storage (Cinder, VsphereVolume...)

  - traditional storage systems (NFS, iSCSI, FC...)

  - distributed storage (Ceph, Glusterfs, Portworx...)

- Using a persistent volume requires:

  - creating the volume out-of-band (outside of the Kubernetes API)

  - referencing the volume in the pod description, with all its parameters

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using a cloud volume

Here is a pod definition using an AWS EBS volume (that has to be created first):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-ebs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-ebs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-ebs
      name: my-ebs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-ebs-volume
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: vol-049df61146c4d7901
      fsType: ext4
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using an NFS volume

Here is another example using a volume on an NFS server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-nfs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-nfs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-nfs
      name: my-nfs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-nfs-volume
      nfs:
        server: 192.168.0.55
        path: "/exports/assets"
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of volumes

- Their lifecycle (creation, deletion...) is managed outside of the Kubernetes API

  (we can't just use `kubectl apply/create/delete/...` to manage them)

- If a Deployment uses a volume, all replicas end up using the same volume

- That volume must then support concurrent access

  - some volumes do (e.g. NFS servers support multiple read/write access)

  - some volumes support concurrent reads

  - some volumes support concurrent access for colocated pods

- What we really need is a way for each replica to have its own volume

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims

- To abstract the different types of storage, a pod can use a special volume type

- This type is a *Persistent Volume Claim*

- A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a resource type

  (visible with `kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims` or `kubectl get pvc`)

- A PVC is not a volume; it is a *request for a volume*

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims in practice

- Using a Persistent Volume Claim is a two-step process:

  - creating the claim

  - using the claim in a pod (as if it were any other kind of volume)

- A PVC starts by being Unbound (without an associated volume)

- Once it is associated with a Persistent Volume, it becomes Bound

- A Pod referring an unbound PVC will not start

  (but as soon as the PVC is bound, the Pod can start)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Binding PV and PVC

- A Kubernetes controller continuously watches PV and PVC objects

- When it notices an unbound PVC, it tries to find a satisfactory PV

  ("satisfactory" in terms of size and other characteristics; see next slide)

- If no PV fits the PVC, a PV can be created dynamically

  (this requires to configure a *dynamic provisioner*, more on that later)

- Otherwise, the PVC remains unbound indefinitely

  (until we manually create a PV or setup dynamic provisioning)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## What's in a Persistent Volume Claim?

- At the very least, the claim should indicate:

  - the size of the volume (e.g. "5 GiB")

  - the access mode (e.g. "read-write by a single pod")

- Optionally, it can also specify a Storage Class

- The Storage Class indicates:

  - which storage system to use (e.g. Portworx, EBS...)

  - extra parameters for that storage system

    e.g.: "replicate the data 3 times, and use SSD media"

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## What's a Storage Class?

- A Storage Class is yet another Kubernetes API resource

  (visible with e.g. `kubectl get storageclass` or `kubectl get sc`)

- It indicates which *provisioner* to use

  (which controller will create the actual volume)

- And arbitrary parameters for that provisioner

  (replication levels, type of disk ... anything relevant!)

- Storage Classes are required if we want to use [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)

  (but we can also create volumes manually, and ignore Storage Classes)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]

## Defining a Persistent Volume Claim

Here is a minimal PVC:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: my-claim
spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using a Persistent Volume Claim

Here is a Pod definition like the ones shown earlier, but using a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-a-claim
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-a-claim
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-vol
      name: my-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-claim
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims and Stateful sets

- The pods in a stateful set can define a `volumeClaimTemplate`

- A `volumeClaimTemplate` will dynamically create one Persistent Volume Claim per pod

- Each pod will therefore have its own volume

- These volumes are numbered (like the pods)

- When updating the stateful set (e.g. image upgrade), each pod keeps its volume

- When pods get rescheduled (e.g. node failure), they keep their volume

  (this requires a storage system that is not node-local)

- These volumes are not automatically deleted

  (when the stateful set is scaled down or deleted)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful set recap

- A Stateful sets manages a number of identical pods

  (like a Deployment)

- These pods are numbered, and started/upgraded/stopped in a specific order

- These pods are aware of their number

  (e.g., #0 can decide to be the primary, and #1 can be secondary)

- These pods can find the IP addresses of the other pods in the set

  (through a *headless service*)

- These pods can each have their own persistent storage

  (Deployments cannot do that)

# Running a Consul cluster

- Here is a good use-case for Stateful sets!

- We are going to deploy a Consul cluster with 3 nodes

- Consul is a highly-available key/value store

  (like etcd or Zookeeper)

- One easy way to bootstrap a cluster is to tell each node:

  - the addresses of other nodes

  - how many nodes are expected (to know when quorum is reached)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping a Consul cluster

*After reading the Consul documentation carefully (and/or asking around),
we figure out the minimal command-line to run our Consul cluster.*

```
consul agent -data-dir=/consul/data -client=0.0.0.0 -server -ui \
       -bootstrap-expect=3 \
       -retry-join=`X.X.X.X` \
       -retry-join=`Y.Y.Y.Y`
```

- Replace X.X.X.X and Y.Y.Y.Y with the addresses of other nodes

- The same command-line can be used on all nodes (convenient!)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Cloud Auto-join

- Since version 1.4.0, Consul can use the Kubernetes API to find its peers

- This is called [Cloud Auto-join]

- Instead of passing an IP address, we need to pass a parameter like this:

  ```
  consul agent -retry-join "provider=k8s label_selector=\"app=consul\""
  ```

- Consul needs to be able to talk to the Kubernetes API

- We can provide a `kubeconfig` file

- If Consul runs in a pod, it will use the *service account* of the pod

[Cloud Auto-join]: https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/cloud-auto-join.html#kubernetes-k8s-

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Setting up Cloud auto-join

- We need to create a service account for Consul

- We need to create a role that can `list` and `get` pods

- We need to bind that role to the service account

- And of course, we need to make sure that Consul pods use that service account

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Putting it all together

- The file `k8s/consul.yaml` defines the required resources

  (service account, cluster role, cluster role binding, service, stateful set)

- It has a few extra touches:

  - a `podAntiAffinity` prevents two pods from running on the same node

  - a `preStop` hook makes the pod leave the cluster when shutdown gracefully

This was inspired by this [excellent tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/consul-on-kubernetes) by Kelsey Hightower.
Some features from the original tutorial (TLS authentication between
nodes and encryption of gossip traffic) were removed for simplicity.

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Running our Consul cluster

- We'll use the provided YAML file

.exercise[

- Create the stateful set and associated service:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul.yaml
  ```

- Check the logs as the pods come up one after another:
  ```bash
  stern consul
  ```

<!--
```wait Synced node info```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Check the health of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Caveats

- We haven't used a `volumeClaimTemplate` here

- That's because we don't have a storage provider yet

  (except if you're running this on your own and your cluster has one)

- What happens if we lose a pod?

  - a new pod gets rescheduled (with an empty state)

  - the new pod tries to connect to the two others

  - it will be accepted (after 1-2 minutes of instability)

  - and it will retrieve the data from the other pods

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Failure modes

- What happens if we lose two pods?

  - manual repair will be required

  - we will need to instruct the remaining one to act solo

  - then rejoin new pods

- What happens if we lose three pods? (aka all of them)

  - we lose all the data (ouch)

- If we run Consul without persistent storage, backups are a good idea!

Local Persistent Volumes

# Local Persistent Volumes

- We want to run that Consul cluster *and* actually persist data

- But we don't have a distributed storage system

- We are going to use local volumes instead

  (similar conceptually to `hostPath` volumes)

- We can use local volumes without installing extra plugins

- However, they are tied to a node

- If that node goes down, the volume becomes unavailable

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## With or without dynamic provisioning

- We will deploy a Consul cluster *with* persistence

- That cluster's StatefulSet will create PVCs

- These PVCs will remain unbound¬π, until we will create local volumes manually

  (we will basically do the job of the dynamic provisioner)

- Then, we will see how to automate that with a dynamic provisioner

.footnote[¬πUnbound = without an associated Persistent Volume.]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## If we have a dynamic provisioner ...

- The labs in this section assume that we *do not* have a dynamic provisioner

- If we do have one, we need to disable it

.exercise[

- Check if we have a dynamic provisioner:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclass
  ```

- If the output contains a line with `(default)`, run this command:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate sc storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class- --all
  ```

- Check again that it is no longer marked as `(default)`

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Work in a separate namespace

- To avoid conflicts with existing resources, let's create and use a new namespace

.exercise[

- Create a new namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace orange
  ```

- Switch to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns orange
  ```

]

.warning[Make sure to call that namespace `orange`: it is hardcoded in the YAML files.]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Deploying Consul

- We will use a slightly different YAML file

- The only differences between that file and the previous one are:

  - `volumeClaimTemplate` defined in the Stateful Set spec

  - the corresponding `volumeMounts` in the Pod spec

  - the namespace `orange` used for discovery of Pods

.exercise[

- Apply the persistent Consul YAML file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/persistent-consul.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Observing the situation

- Let's look at Persistent Volume Claims and Pods

.exercise[

- Check that we now have an unbound Persistent Volume Claim:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  ```

- We don't have any Persistent Volume:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pv
  ```

- The Pod `consul-0` is not scheduled yet:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

*Hint: leave these commands running with `-w` in different windows.*

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Explanations

- In a Stateful Set, the Pods are started one by one

- `consul-1` won't be created until `consul-0` is running

- `consul-0` has a dependency on an unbound Persistent Volume Claim

- The scheduler won't schedule the Pod until the PVC is bound

  (because the PVC might be bound to a volume that is only available on a subset of nodes; for instance EBS are tied to an availability zone)

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Creating Persistent Volumes

- Let's create 3 local directories (`/mnt/consul`) on node2, node3, node4

- Then create 3 Persistent Volumes corresponding to these directories

.exercise[

- Create the local directories:
  ```bash
    for NODE in node2 node3 node4; do
      ssh $NODE sudo mkdir -p /mnt/consul
    done
  ```

- Create the PV objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/volumes-for-consul.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Check our Consul cluster

- The PVs that we created will be automatically matched with the PVCs

- Once a PVC is bound, its pod can start normally

- Once the pod `consul-0` has started, `consul-1` can be created, etc.

- Eventually, our Consul cluster is up, and backend by "persistent" volumes

.exercise[

- Check that our Consul clusters has 3 members indeed:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (1/2)

- The size of the Persistent Volumes is bogus

  (it is used when matching PVs and PVCs together, but there is no actual quota or limit)

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (2/2)

- This specific example worked because we had exactly 1 free PV per node:

  - if we had created multiple PVs per node ...

  - we could have ended with two PVCs bound to PVs on the same node ...

  - which would have required two pods to be on the same node ...

  - which is forbidden by the anti-affinity constraints in the StatefulSet

- To avoid that, we need to associated the PVs with a Storage Class that has:
  ```yaml
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  ```
  (this means that a PVC will be bound to a PV only after being used by a Pod)

- See [this blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/) for more details

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Bulk provisioning

- It's not practical to manually create directories and PVs for each app

- We *could* pre-provision a number of PVs across our fleet

- We could even automate that with a Daemon Set:

  - creating a number of directories on each node

  - creating the corresponding PV objects

- We also need to recycle volumes

- ... This can quickly get out of hand

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Dynamic provisioning

- We could also write our own provisioner, which would:

  - watch the PVCs across all namespaces

  - when a PVC is created, create a corresponding PV on a node

- Or we could use one of the dynamic provisioners for local persistent volumes

  (for instance the [Rancher local path provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner))

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Strategies for local persistent volumes

- Remember, when a node goes down, the volumes on that node become unavailable

- High availability will require another layer of replication

  (like what we've just seen with Consul; or primary/secondary; etc)

- Pre-provisioning PVs makes sense for machines with local storage

  (e.g. cloud instance storage; or storage directly attached to a physical machine)

- Dynamic provisioning makes sense for large number of applications

  (when we can't or won't dedicate a whole disk to a volume)

- It's possible to mix both (using distinct Storage Classes)

# Highly available Persistent Volumes

- How can we achieve true durability?

- How can we store data that would survive the loss of a node?

--

- We need to use Persistent Volumes backed by highly available storage systems

- There are many ways to achieve that:

  - leveraging our cloud's storage APIs

  - using NAS/SAN systems or file servers

  - distributed storage systems

--

- We are going to see one distributed storage system in action

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Our test scenario

- We will set up a distributed storage system on our cluster

- We will use it to deploy a SQL database (PostgreSQL)

- We will insert some test data in the database

- We will disrupt the node running the database

- We will see how it recovers

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Portworx

- Portworx is a *commercial* persistent storage solution for containers

- It works with Kubernetes, but also Mesos, Swarm ...

- It provides [hyper-converged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure) storage

  (=storage is provided by regular compute nodes)

- We're going to use it here because it can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster

  (it doesn't require any particular infrastructure)

- We don't endorse or support Portworx in any particular way

  (but we appreciate that it's super easy to install!)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## A useful reminder

- We're installing Portworx because we need a storage system

- If you are using AKS, EKS, GKE ... you already have a storage system

  (but you might want another one, e.g. to leverage local storage)

- If you have setup Kubernetes yourself, there are other solutions available too

  - on premises, you can use a good old SAN/NAS

  - on a private cloud like OpenStack, you can use e.g. Cinder

  - everywhere, you can use other systems, e.g. Gluster, StorageOS

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Portworx requirements

- Kubernetes cluster ‚úîÔ∏è

- Optional key/value store (etcd or Consul) ‚ùå

- At least one available block device ‚ùå

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## The key-value store

- In the current version of Portworx (1.4) it is recommended to use etcd or Consul

- But Portworx also has beta support for an embedded key/value store

- For simplicity, we are going to use the latter option

  (but if we have deployed Consul or etcd, we can use that, too)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## One available block device

- Block device = disk or partition on a disk

- We can see block devices with `lsblk`

  (or `cat /proc/partitions` if we're old school like that!)

- If we don't have a spare disk or partition, we can use a *loop device*

- A loop device is a block device actually backed by a file

- These are frequently used to mount ISO (CD/DVD) images or VM disk images

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Setting up a loop device

- We are going to create a 10 GB (empty) file on each node

- Then make a loop device from it, to be used by Portworx

.exercise[

- Create a 10 GB file on each node:
  ```bash
  for N in $(seq 1 4); do ssh node$N sudo truncate --size 10G /portworx.blk; done
  ```
  (If SSH asks to confirm host keys, enter `yes` each time.)

- Associate the file to a loop device on each node:
  ```bash
  for N in $(seq 1 4); do ssh node$N sudo losetup /dev/loop4 /portworx.blk; done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Installing Portworx

- To install Portworx, we need to go to https://install.portworx.com/

- This website will ask us a bunch of questions about our cluster

- Then, it will generate a YAML file that we should apply to our cluster

--

- Or, we can just apply that YAML file directly (it's in `k8s/portworx.yaml`)

.exercise[

- Install Portworx:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/portworx.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Generating a custom YAML file

If you want to generate a YAML file tailored to your own needs, the easiest
way is to use https://install.portworx.com/.

FYI, this is how we obtained the YAML file used earlier:
```
KBVER=$(kubectl version -o json | jq -r .serverVersion.gitVersion)
BLKDEV=/dev/loop4
curl https://install.portworx.com/1.4/?kbver=$KBVER&b=true&s=$BLKDEV&c=px-workshop&stork=true&lh=true
```
If you want to use an external key/value store, add one of the following:
```
&k=etcd://`XXX`:2379
&k=consul://`XXX`:8500
```
... where `XXX` is the name or address of your etcd or Consul server.

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Waiting for Portworx to be ready

- The installation process will take a few minutes

.exercise[

- Check out the logs:
  ```bash
  stern -n kube-system portworx
  ```

- Wait until it gets quiet

  (you should see `portworx service is healthy`, too)

<!--
```longwait PX node status reports portworx service is healthy```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes

- We are going to run PostgreSQL in a Stateful set

- The Stateful set will specify a `volumeClaimTemplate`

- That `volumeClaimTemplate` will create Persistent Volume Claims

- Kubernetes' [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) will satisfy these Persistent Volume Claims

  (by creating Persistent Volumes and binding them to the claims)

- The Persistent Volumes are then available for the PostgreSQL pods

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Storage Classes

- It's possible that multiple storage systems are available

- Or, that a storage system offers multiple tiers of storage

  (SSD vs. magnetic; mirrored or not; etc.)

- We need to tell Kubernetes *which* system and tier to use

- This is achieved by creating a Storage Class

- A `volumeClaimTemplate` can indicate which Storage Class to use

- It is also possible to mark a Storage Class as "default"

  (it will be used if a `volumeClaimTemplate` doesn't specify one)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Our default Storage Class

This is our Storage Class (in `k8s/storage-class.yaml`):

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: portworx-replicated
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
parameters:
 repl: "2"
 priority_io: "high"
```

- It says "use Portworx to create volumes"

- It tells Portworx to "keep 2 replicas of these volumes"

- It marks the Storage Class as being the default one

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Creating our Storage Class

- Let's apply that YAML file!

.exercise[

- Create the Storage Class:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/storage-class.yaml
  ```

- Check that it is now available:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sc
  ```

]

It should show as `portworx-replicated (default)`.

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Our Postgres Stateful set

- The next slide shows `k8s/postgres.yaml`

- It defines a Stateful set

- With a `volumeClaimTemplate` requesting a 1 GB volume

- That volume will be mounted to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`

- There is another little detail: we enable the `stork` scheduler

- The `stork` scheduler is optional (it's specific to Portworx)

- It helps the Kubernetes scheduler to colocate the pod with its volume

  (see [this blog post](https://portworx.com/stork-storage-orchestration-kubernetes/) for more details about that)

## Creating the Stateful set

- Before applying the YAML, watch what's going on with `kubectl get events -w`

.exercise[

- Apply that YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/postgres.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod postgres-0 --for condition=ready``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Testing our PostgreSQL pod

- We will use `kubectl exec` to get a shell in the pod

- Good to know: we need to use the `postgres` user in the pod

.exercise[

- Get a shell in the pod, as the `postgres` user:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 su postgres
  ```

<!--
autopilot prompt detection expects $ or # at the beginning of the line.
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Check that default databases have been created correctly:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

]

(This should show us 3 lines: postgres, template0, and template1.)

## Inserting data in PostgreSQL

- We will create a database and populate it with `pgbench`

.exercise[

- Create a database named `demo`:
  ```bash
  createdb demo
  ```

- Populate it with `pgbench`:
  ```bash
  pgbench -i -s 10 demo
  ```

]

- The `-i` flag means "create tables"

- The `-s 10` flag means "create 10 x 100,000 rows"

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Checking how much data we have now

- The `pgbench` tool inserts rows in table `pgbench_accounts`

.exercise[

- Check that the `demo` base exists:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

- Check how many rows we have in `pgbench_accounts`:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_accounts"
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

(We should see a count of 1,000,000 rows.)

## Find out which node is hosting the database

- We can find that information with `kubectl get pods -o wide`

.exercise[

- Check the node running the database:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

]

We are going to disrupt that node.

--

By "disrupt" we mean: "disconnect it from the network".

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Disconnect the node

- We will use `iptables` to block all traffic exiting the node

  (except SSH traffic, so we can repair the node later if needed)

.exercise[

- SSH to the node to disrupt:
  ```bash
  ssh `nodeX`
  ```

- Allow SSH traffic leaving the node, but block all other traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -j DROP
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Check that the node is disconnected

.exercise[

- Check that the node can't communicate with other nodes:
  ```
  ping node1
  ```

- Logout to go back on `node1`

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

- Watch the events unfolding with `kubectl get events -w` and `kubectl get pods -w`

]

- It will take some time for Kubernetes to mark the node as unhealthy

- Then it will attempt to reschedule the pod to another node

- In about a minute, our pod should be up and running again

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Check that our data is still available

- We are going to reconnect to the (new) pod and check

.exercise[

- Get a shell on the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 su postgres
  ```

<!--
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Check the number of rows in the `pgbench_accounts` table:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_accounts"
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Double-check that the pod has really moved

- Just to make sure the system is not bluffing!

.exercise[

- Look at which node the pod is now running on
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Re-enable the node

- Let's fix the node that we disconnected from the network

.exercise[

- SSH to the node:
  ```bash
  ssh `nodeX`
  ```

- Remove the iptables rule blocking traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -D OUTPUT 2
  ```

]

## A few words about this PostgreSQL setup

- In a real deployment, you would want to set a password

- This can be done by creating a `secret`:
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic postgres \
          --from-literal=password=$(base64 /dev/urandom | head -c16)
  ```

- And then passing that secret to the container:
  ```yaml
  env:
  - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: postgres
        key: password
  ```

## Troubleshooting Portworx

- If we need to see what's going on with Portworx:
  ```
  PXPOD=$(kubectl -n kube-system get pod -l name=portworx -o json | 
  	      jq -r .items[0].metadata.name)
  kubectl -n kube-system exec $PXPOD -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
  ```

- We can also connect to Lighthouse (a web UI)

  - check the port with `kubectl -n kube-system get svc px-lighthouse`

  - connect to that port

  - the default login/password is `admin/Password1`

  - then specify `portworx-service` as the endpoint

## Removing Portworx

- Portworx provides a storage driver

- It needs to place itself "above" the Kubelet

  (it installs itself straight on the nodes)

- To remove it, we need to do more than just deleting its Kubernetes resources

- It is done by applying a special label:
  ```
  kubectl label nodes --all px/enabled=remove --overwrite
  ```

- Then removing a bunch of local files:
  ```
  sudo chattr -i /etc/pwx/.private.json
  sudo rm -rf /etc/pwx /opt/pwx
  ```

  (on each node where Portworx was running)

## Dynamic provisioning without a provider

- What if we want to use Stateful sets without a storage provider?

- We will have to create volumes manually

  (by creating Persistent Volume objects)

- These volumes will be automatically bound with matching Persistent Volume Claims

- We can use local volumes (essentially bind mounts of host directories)

- Of course, these volumes won't be available in case of node failure

- Check [this blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/) for more information and gotchas

## Acknowledgements

The Portworx installation tutorial, and the PostgreSQL example,
were inspired by [Portworx examples on Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/), in particular:

- [installing Portworx on Kubernetes](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/deploy-px-k8s)

  (with adapatations to use a loop device and an embedded key/value store)

- [persistent volumes on Kubernetes using Portworx](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/px-k8s-vol-basic)

  (with adapatations to specify a default Storage Class)

- [HA PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with Portworx](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/px-k8s-postgres-all-in-one)

  (with adaptations to use a Stateful Set and simplify PostgreSQL's setup)
