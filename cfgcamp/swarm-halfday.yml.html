## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [J√©r√¥me Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials

- Over time, [multiple contributors](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/graphs/contributors) also helped to improve these materials ‚Äî thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) ...

- ... And looking for answers in the [Docker forums](forums.docker.com),
  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker),
  and other outlets

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to some Docker nodes

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster

# Pre-requirements

- Be comfortable with the UNIX command line

  - navigating directories

  - editing files

  - a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

- Some Docker knowledge

  - `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`

  - ideally, you know how to write a Dockerfile and build it
    <br/>
    (even if it's a `FROM` line and a couple of `RUN` commands)

- It's totally OK if you are not a Docker expert!

- You are invited to reproduce all the demos

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

## You get a cluster of cloud VMs

- Each person gets a private cluster of cloud VMs (not shared with anybody else)

- They'll remain up for the duration of the workshop

- You should have a little card with login+password+IP addresses

- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

- The nodes have aliases: `node1`, `node2`, etc.

## Why don't we run containers locally?

- Installing this stuff can be hard on some machines

  (32 bits CPU or OS... Laptops without administrator access... etc.)

- *"The whole team downloaded all these container images from the WiFi!
  <br/>... and it went great!"* (Literally no-one ever)

- All you need is a computer (or even a phone or tablet!), with:

  - an internet connection

  - a web browser

  - an SSH client

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person

## SSH clients

- On Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set

- On Windows, get one of these:

  - [putty](http://www.putty.org/)
  - Microsoft [Win32 OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH)
  - [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
  - [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- On Android, [JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com/)
  ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh))
  works pretty well

- Nice-to-have: [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of SSH, if your internet connection tends to lose packets

---

class: in-person, extra-details

## What is this Mosh thing?

*You don't have to use Mosh or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
We're just telling you about it because some of us think it's cool!*

- Mosh is "the mobile shell"

- It is essentially SSH over UDP, with roaming features

- It retransmits packets quickly, so it works great even on lossy connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It has intelligent local echo, so it works great even in high-latency connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It supports transparent roaming when your client IP address changes

  (Like when you hop from hotel to conference WiFi)

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person, extra-details

## Using Mosh

- To install it: `(apt|yum|brew) install mosh`

- It has been pre-installed on the VMs that we are using

- To connect to a remote machine: `mosh user@host`

  (It is going to establish an SSH connection, then hand off to UDP)

- It requires UDP ports to be open

  (By default, it uses a UDP port between 60000 and 61000)

## Connecting to our lab environment

.exercise[

- Log into the first VM (`node1`) with your SSH client

<!--
```bash
for N in $(awk '/\Wnode/{print $2}' /etc/hosts); do
  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $N true
done
```

```bash
### FIXME find a way to reset the cluster, maybe?
```
-->

- Check that you can SSH (without password) to `node2`:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```
- Type `exit` or `^D` to come back to `node1`

<!-- ```bash exit``` -->

]

If anything goes wrong ‚Äî ask for help!

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Doing or re-doing the workshop on your own?

- Use something like
  [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com/) or
  [Play-With-Kubernetes](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/)

  Zero setup effort; but environment are short-lived and
  might have limited resources

- Create your own cluster (local or cloud VMs)

  Small setup effort; small cost; flexible environments

- Create a bunch of clusters for you and your friends
    ([instructions](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/prepare-vms))

  Bigger setup effort; ideal for group training

---

class: self-paced

## Get your own Docker nodes

- If you already have some Docker nodes: great!

- If not: let's get some thanks to Play-With-Docker

.exercise[

- Go to http://www.play-with-docker.com/

- Log in

- Create your first node

<!-- ```open http://www.play-with-docker.com/``` -->

]

You will need a Docker ID to use Play-With-Docker.

(Creating a Docker ID is free.)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## We will (mostly) interact with node1 only

*These remarks apply only when using multiple nodes, of course.*

- Unless instructed, **all commands must be run from the first VM, `node1`**

- We will only check out/copy the code on `node1`

- During normal operations, we do not need access to the other nodes

- If we had to troubleshoot issues, we would use a combination of:

  - SSH (to access system logs, daemon status...)

  - Docker API (to check running containers and container engine status)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Terminals

Once in a while, the instructions will say:
<br/>"Open a new terminal."

There are multiple ways to do this:

- create a new window or tab on your machine, and SSH into the VM;

- use screen or tmux on the VM and open a new window from there.

You are welcome to use the method that you feel the most comfortable with.

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Tmux cheatsheet

[Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a terminal multiplexer like `screen`.

*You don't have to use it or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
But some of us like to use it to switch between terminals.
<br/>
It has been preinstalled on your workshop nodes.*

- Ctrl-b c ‚Üí creates a new window
- Ctrl-b n ‚Üí go to next window
- Ctrl-b p ‚Üí go to previous window
- Ctrl-b " ‚Üí split window top/bottom
- Ctrl-b % ‚Üí split window left/right
- Ctrl-b Alt-1 ‚Üí rearrange windows in columns
- Ctrl-b Alt-2 ‚Üí rearrange windows in rows
- Ctrl-b arrows ‚Üí navigate to other windows
- Ctrl-b d ‚Üí detach session
- tmux attach ‚Üí reattach to session

## Wait, what, 18.09 ?!?

--

- Docker 1.13 = Docker 17.03 (year.month, like Ubuntu)

- Every month, there is a new "edge" release (with new features)

- Every quarter, there is a new "stable" release

- Docker CE releases are maintained 4+ months

- Docker EE releases are maintained 12+ months

- For more details, check the [Docker EE announcement blog post](https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/)

class: extra-details

## Docker CE vs Docker EE

- Docker EE:

  - $$$
  - certification for select distros, clouds, and plugins
  - advanced management features (fine-grained access control, security scanning...)

- Docker CE:

  - free
  - available through Docker Mac, Docker Windows, and major Linux distros
  - perfect for individuals and small organizations

.debug[[swarm/versions.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/versions.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why?

- More readable for enterprise users

  (i.e. the very nice folks who are kind enough to pay us big $$$ for our stuff)

- No impact for the community

  (beyond CE/EE suffix and version numbering change)

- Both trains leverage the same open source components

  (containerd, libcontainer, SwarmKit...)

- More predictable release schedule (see next slide)

# Our sample application

- We will clone the GitHub repository onto our `node1`

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
cd ~
if [ -d container.training ]; then
  mv container.training container.training.$RANDOM
fi
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

]

(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

---

## Downloading and running the application

Let's start this before we look around, as downloading will take a little time...

.exercise[

- Go to the `dockercoins` directory, in the cloned repo:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/dockercoins
  ```

- Use Compose to build and run all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

<!--
```longwait units of work done```
-->

]

Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling
the corresponding base images), then starts all containers,
and displays aggregated logs.

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## What's this application?

--

- It is a DockerCoin miner! .emoji[üí∞üê≥üì¶üö¢]

--

- No, you can't buy coffee with DockerCoins

--

- How DockerCoins works:

  - generate a few random bytes

  - hash these bytes

  - increment a counter (to keep track of speed)

  - repeat forever!

--

- DockerCoins is *not* a cryptocurrency

  (the only common points are "randomness," "hashing," and "coins" in the name)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## DockerCoins in the microservices era

- DockerCoins is made of 5 services:

  - `rng` = web service generating random bytes

  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data

  - `worker` = background process calling `rng` and `hasher`

  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

  - `redis` = data store (holds a counter updated by `worker`)

- These 5 services are visible in the application's Compose file,
  [docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## How DockerCoins works

- `worker` invokes web service `rng` to generate random bytes

- `worker` invokes web service `hasher` to hash these bytes

- `worker` does this in an infinite loop

- every second, `worker` updates `redis` to indicate how many loops were done

- `webui` queries `redis`, and computes and exposes "hashing speed" in our browser

*(See diagram on next slide!)*

---

## Service discovery in container-land

How does each service find out the address of the other ones?

--

- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code

- We do not hard-code FQDNs in the code, either

- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest

  (And by container-magic, we mean "a crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server")

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Example in `worker/worker.py`

```python
redis = Redis("`redis`")


def get_random_bytes():
    r = requests.get("http://`rng`/32")
    return r.content


def hash_bytes(data):
    r = requests.post("http://`hasher`/",
                      data=data,
                      headers={"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"})
```

class: extra-details

## Links, naming, and service discovery

- Containers can have network aliases (resolvable through DNS)

- Compose file version 2+ makes each container reachable through its service name

- Compose file version 1 required "links" sections to accomplish this

- Network aliases are automatically namespaced

  - you can have multiple apps declaring and using a service named `database`

  - containers in the blue app will resolve `database` to the IP of the blue database

  - containers in the green app will resolve `database` to the IP of the green database

## Show me the code!

- You can check the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- The Compose file ([docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml))
  lists all 5 services

- `redis` is using an official image from the Docker Hub

- `hasher`, `rng`, `worker`, `webui` are each built from a Dockerfile

- Each service's Dockerfile and source code is in its own directory

  (`hasher` is in the [hasher](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/) directory,
  `rng` is in the [rng](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/)
  directory, etc.)

## Compose file format version

*This is relevant only if you have used Compose before 2016...*

- Compose 1.6 introduced support for a new Compose file format (aka "v2")

- Services are no longer at the top level, but under a `services` section

- There has to be a `version` key at the top level, with value `"2"` (as a string, not an integer)

- Containers are placed on a dedicated network, making links unnecessary

- There are other minor differences, but upgrade is easy and straightforward

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Our application at work

- On the left-hand side, the "rainbow strip" shows the container names

- On the right-hand side, we see the output of our containers

- We can see the `worker` service making requests to `rng` and `hasher`

- For `rng` and `hasher`, we see HTTP access logs

## Connecting to the web UI

- "Logs are exciting and fun!" (No-one, ever)

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.exercise[

- With a web browser, connect to `node1` on port 8000

- Remember: the `nodeX` aliases are valid only on the nodes themselves

- In your browser, you need to enter the IP address of your node

<!-- ```open http://node1:8000``` -->

]

A drawing area should show up, and after a few seconds, a blue
graph will appear.

---

class: self-paced, extra-details

## If the graph doesn't load

If you just see a `Page not found` error, it might be because your
Docker Engine is running on a different machine. This can be the case if:

- you are using the Docker Toolbox

- you are using a VM (local or remote) created with Docker Machine

- you are controlling a remote Docker Engine

When you run DockerCoins in development mode, the web UI static files
are mapped to the container using a volume. Alas, volumes can only
work on a local environment, or when using Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows.

How to fix this?

Stop the app with `^C`, edit `dockercoins.yml`, comment out the `volumes` section, and try again.

## Why does the speed seem irregular?

- It *looks like* the speed is approximately 4 hashes/second

- Or more precisely: 4 hashes/second, with regular dips down to zero

- Why?

--

class: extra-details

- The app actually has a constant, steady speed: 3.33 hashes/second
  <br/>
  (which corresponds to 1 hash every 0.3 seconds, for *reasons*)

- Yes, and?

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The reason why this graph is *not awesome*

- The worker doesn't update the counter after every loop, but up to once per second

- The speed is computed by the browser, checking the counter about once per second

- Between two consecutive updates, the counter will increase either by 4, or by 0

- The perceived speed will therefore be 4 - 4 - 4 - 0 - 4 - 4 - 0 etc.

- What can we conclude from this?

---

## Stopping the application

- If we interrupt Compose (with `^C`), it will politely ask the Docker Engine to stop the app

- The Docker Engine will send a `TERM` signal to the containers

- If the containers do not exit in a timely manner, the Engine sends a `KILL` signal

.exercise[

- Stop the application by hitting `^C`

<!--
```keys ^C```
-->

]

--

Some containers exit immediately, others take longer.

The containers that do not handle `SIGTERM` end up being killed after a 10s timeout. If we are very impatient, we can hit `^C` a second time!


.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---
## Restarting in the background

- Many flags and commands of Compose are modeled after those of `docker`

.exercise[

- Start the app in the background with the `-d` option:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Check that our app is running with the `ps` command:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

]

`docker-compose ps` also shows the ports exposed by the application.

## Viewing logs

- The `docker-compose logs` command works like `docker logs`

.exercise[

- View all logs since container creation and exit when done:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- Stream container logs, starting at the last 10 lines for each container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs --tail 10 --follow
  ```

<!--
```wait units of work done```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

Tip: use `^S` and `^Q` to pause/resume log output.

## Scaling up the application

- Our goal is to make that performance graph go up (without changing a line of code!)

--

- Before trying to scale the application, we'll figure out if we need more resources

  (CPU, RAM...)

- For that, we will use good old UNIX tools on our Docker node

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---

## Looking at resource usage

- Let's look at CPU, memory, and I/O usage

.exercise[

- run `top` to see CPU and memory usage (you should see idle cycles)

<!--
```bash top```

```wait Tasks```
```keys ^C```
-->

- run `vmstat 1` to see I/O usage (si/so/bi/bo)
  <br/>(the 4 numbers should be almost zero, except `bo` for logging)

<!--
```bash vmstat 1```

```wait memory```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

We have available resources.

- Why?
- How can we use them?

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---

## Scaling workers on a single node

- Docker Compose supports scaling
- Let's scale `worker` and see what happens!

.exercise[

- Start one more `worker` container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --scale worker=2
  ```

- Look at the performance graph (it should show a x2 improvement)

- Look at the aggregated logs of our containers (`worker_2` should show up)

- Look at the impact on CPU load with e.g. top (it should be negligible)

]

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---

## Adding more workers

- Great, let's add more workers and call it a day, then!

.exercise[

- Start eight more `worker` containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --scale worker=10
  ```

- Look at the performance graph: does it show a x10 improvement?

- Look at the aggregated logs of our containers

- Look at the impact on CPU load and memory usage

# Identifying bottlenecks

- You should have seen a 3x speed bump (not 10x)

- Adding workers didn't result in linear improvement

- *Something else* is slowing us down

--

- ... But what?

--

- The code doesn't have instrumentation

- Let's use state-of-the-art HTTP performance analysis!
  <br/>(i.e. good old tools like `ab`, `httping`...)

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---

## Accessing internal services

- `rng` and `hasher` are exposed on ports 8001 and 8002

- This is declared in the Compose file:

  ```yaml
    ...
    rng:
      build: rng
      ports:
      - "8001:80"

    hasher:
      build: hasher
      ports:
      - "8002:80"
    ...
  ```

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---

## Measuring latency under load

We will use `httping`.

.exercise[

- Check the latency of `rng`:
  ```bash
  httping -c 3 localhost:8001
  ```

- Check the latency of `hasher`:
  ```bash
  httping -c 3 localhost:8002
  ```

]

`rng` has a much higher latency than `hasher`.

.debug[[shared/composescale.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/composescale.md)]
---
## Let's draw hasty conclusions

- The bottleneck seems to be `rng`

- *What if* we don't have enough entropy and can't generate enough random numbers?

- We need to scale out the `rng` service on multiple machines!

Note: this is a fiction! We have enough entropy. But we need a pretext to scale out.

(In fact, the code of `rng` uses `/dev/urandom`, which never runs out of entropy...
<br/>
...and is [just as good as `/dev/random`](http://www.slideshare.net/PacSecJP/filippo-plain-simple-reality-of-entropy).)

.debug[[shared/hastyconclusions.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/hastyconclusions.md)]

## Clean up

  docker-compose down

# SwarmKit

- [SwarmKit](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit) is an open source
  toolkit to build multi-node systems

- It is a reusable library, like libcontainer, libnetwork, vpnkit ...

- It is a plumbing part of the Docker ecosystem

--

.debug[[swarm/swarmkit.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/swarmkit.md)]
---

## SwarmKit features

- Highly-available, distributed store based on [Raft](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_%28computer_science%29)
  <br/>(avoids depending on an external store: easier to deploy; higher performance)

- Dynamic reconfiguration of Raft without interrupting cluster operations

- *Services* managed with a *declarative API*
  <br/>(implementing *desired state* and *reconciliation loop*)

- Integration with overlay networks and load balancing

- Strong emphasis on security:

  - automatic TLS keying and signing; automatic cert rotation
  - full encryption of the data plane; automatic key rotation
  - least privilege architecture (single-node compromise ‚â† cluster compromise)
  - on-disk encryption with optional passphrase

.debug[[swarm/swarmkit.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/swarmkit.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Where is the key/value store?

- Many orchestration systems use a key/value store backed by a consensus algorithm
  <br/>
  (k8s‚Üíetcd‚ÜíRaft, mesos‚Üízookeeper‚ÜíZAB, etc.)

- SwarmKit implements the Raft algorithm directly
  <br/>
  (Nomad is similar; thanks [@cbednarski](https://twitter.com/@cbednarski),
  [@diptanu](https://twitter.com/diptanu) and others for pointing it out!)

- Analogy courtesy of [@aluzzardi](https://twitter.com/aluzzardi):

  *It's like B-Trees and RDBMS. They are different layers, often
  associated. But you don't need to bring up a full SQL server when
  all you need is to index some data.*

- As a result, the orchestrator has direct access to the data
  <br/>
  (the main copy of the data is stored in the orchestrator's memory)

- Simpler, easier to deploy and operate; also faster

.debug[[swarm/swarmkit.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/swarmkit.md)]
---

## SwarmKit concepts (1/2)

- A *cluster* will be at least one *node* (preferably more)

- A *node* can be a *manager* or a *worker*

- A *manager* actively takes part in the Raft consensus, and keeps the Raft log

- You can talk to a *manager* using the SwarmKit API

- One *manager* is elected as the *leader*; other managers merely forward requests to it

- The *workers* get their instructions from the *managers*

- Both *workers* and *managers* can run containers

---

## SwarmKit concepts (2/2)

- The *managers* expose the SwarmKit API

- Using the API, you can indicate that you want to run a *service*

- A *service* is specified by its *desired state*: which image, how many instances...

- The *leader* uses different subsystems to break down services into *tasks*:
  <br/>orchestrator, scheduler, allocator, dispatcher

- A *task* corresponds to a specific container, assigned to a specific *node*

- *Nodes* know which *tasks* should be running, and will start or stop containers accordingly (through the Docker Engine API)

You can refer to the [NOMENCLATURE](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/blob/master/design/nomenclature.md) in the SwarmKit repo for more details.

# Declarative vs imperative

- Our container orchestrator puts a very strong emphasis on being *declarative*

- Declarative:

  *I would like a cup of tea.*

- Imperative:

  *Boil some water. Pour it in a teapot. Add tea leaves. Steep for a while. Serve in a cup.*

--

- Declarative seems simpler at first ...

- ... As long as you know how to brew tea

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/shared/declarative.md)]

## Declarative vs imperative

- What declarative would really be:

  *I want a cup of tea, obtained by pouring an infusion¬π of tea leaves in a cup.*

--

  *¬πAn infusion is obtained by letting the object steep a few minutes in hot¬≤ water.*

--

  *¬≤Hot liquid is obtained by pouring it in an appropriate container¬≥ and setting it on a stove.*

--

  *¬≥Ah, finally, containers! Something we know about. Let's get to work, shall we?*

## Declarative vs imperative

- Declarative systems:

  - if a task is interrupted (or if we show up to the party half-way through),
    we can figure out what's missing and do only what's necessary

  - we need to be able to *observe* the system

  - ... and compute a "diff" between *what we have* and *what we want*

# Swarm mode

- Since version 1.12, the Docker Engine embeds SwarmKit

- All the SwarmKit features are "asleep" until you enable "Swarm mode"

- Examples of Swarm Mode commands:

  - `docker swarm` (enable Swarm mode; join a Swarm; adjust cluster parameters)

  - `docker node` (view nodes; promote/demote managers; manage nodes)

  - `docker service` (create and manage services)

???

- The Docker API exposes the same concepts

- The SwarmKit API is also exposed (on a separate socket)

.debug[[swarm/swarmmode.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/swarmmode.md)]
---

## Swarm mode needs to be explicitly activated

- By default, all this new code is inactive

- Swarm mode can be enabled, "unlocking" SwarmKit functions
  <br/>(services, out-of-the-box overlay networks, etc.)

.exercise[

- Try a Swarm-specific command:
  ```bash
  docker node ls

---

class: advertise-addr

## IP address to advertise

- When running in Swarm mode, each node *advertises* its address to the others
  <br/>
  (i.e. it tells them *"you can contact me on 10.1.2.3:2377"*)

- If the node has only one IP address, it is used automatically
  <br/>
  (The addresses of the loopback interface and the Docker bridge are ignored)

- If the node has multiple IP addresses, you **must** specify which one to use
  <br/>
  (Docker refuses to pick one randomly)

- You can specify an IP address or an interface name
  <br/>
  (in the latter case, Docker will read the IP address of the interface and use it)

- You can also specify a port number
  <br/>
  (otherwise, the default port 2377 will be used)

.debug[[swarm/creatingswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/creatingswarm.md)]
---

class: advertise-addr

## Using a non-default port number

- Changing the *advertised* port does not change the *listening* port

- If you only pass `--advertise-addr eth0:7777`, Swarm will still listen on port 2377

- You will probably need to pass `--listen-addr eth0:7777` as well

- This is to accommodate scenarios where these ports *must* be different
  <br/>
  (port mapping, load balancers...)

Example to run Swarm on a different port:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0:7777 --listen-addr eth0:7777
```

.debug[[swarm/creatingswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/creatingswarm.md)]
---

class: advertise-addr

## Which IP address should be advertised?

- If your nodes have only one IP address, it's safe to let autodetection do the job

  .small[(Except if your instances have different private and public addresses, e.g.
  on EC2, and you are building a Swarm involving nodes inside and outside the
  private network: then you should advertise the public address.)]

- If your nodes have multiple IP addresses, pick an address which is reachable
  *by every other node* of the Swarm

- If you are using [play-with-docker](http://play-with-docker.com/), use the IP
  address shown next to the node name

  .small[(This is the address of your node on your private internal overlay network.
  The other address that you might see is the address of your node on the
  `docker_gwbridge` network, which is used for outbound traffic.)]

Examples:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.24.0.2
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0
```

## Using a separate interface for the data path

- You can use different interfaces (or IP addresses) for control and data

- You set the _control plane path_ with `--advertise-addr` and `--listen-addr`

  (This will be used for SwarmKit manager/worker communication, leader election, etc.)

- You set the _data plane path_ with `--data-path-addr`

  (This will be used for traffic between containers)

- Both flags can accept either an IP address, or an interface name

  (When specifying an interface name, Docker will use its first IP address)

## Token generation

- In the output of `docker swarm init`, we have a message
  confirming that our node is now the (single) manager:

  ```
  Swarm initialized: current node (8jud...) is now a manager.
  ```

- Docker generated two security tokens (like passphrases or passwords) for our cluster

- The CLI shows us the command to use on other nodes to add them to the cluster using the "worker"
  security token:

  ```
    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
      docker swarm join \
      --token SWMTKN-1-59fl4ak4nqjmao1ofttrc4eprhrola2l87... \

## Adding nodes to the Swarm

- A cluster with one node is not a lot of fun

- Let's add `node2`!

- We need the token that was shown earlier

--

- You wrote it down, right?

--

- Don't panic, we can easily see it again .emoji[üòè]

## Adding nodes to the Swarm

.exercise[

- Show the token again:
  ```bash
  docker swarm join-token worker
  ```

- Log into `node2`:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```

- Copy-paste the `docker swarm join ...` command
  <br/>(that was displayed just before)

<!-- ```copypaste docker swarm join --token SWMTKN.*?:2377``` -->

]

class: extra-details

## Check that the node was added correctly

- Stay on `node2` for now!

.exercise[

- We can still use `docker info` to verify that the node is part of the Swarm:
  ```bash
  docker info | grep ^Swarm
  ```

]

- However, Swarm commands will not work; try, for instance:
  ```bash
  docker node ls
  ```

<!-- Ignore errors: .dummy[```wait not a swarm manager```] -->

- This is because the node that we added is currently a *worker*
- Only *managers* can accept Swarm-specific commands

.debug[[swarm/creatingswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/creatingswarm.md)]

## View our two-node cluster

- Let's go back to `node1` and see what our cluster looks like

.exercise[

- Switch back to `node1` (with `exit`, `Ctrl-D` ...)

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

- View the cluster from `node1`, which is a manager:
  ```bash
  docker node ls
  ```

]

The output should be similar to the following:
```
ID             HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
8jud...ox4b *  node1     Ready   Active        Leader

## Under the hood: docker swarm init

When we do `docker swarm init`:

- a keypair is created for the root CA of our Swarm

- a keypair is created for the first node

- a certificate is issued for this node

- the join tokens are created

## Under the hood: join tokens

There is one token to *join as a worker*, and another to *join as a manager*.

The join tokens have two parts:

- a secret key (preventing unauthorized nodes from joining)

- a fingerprint of the root CA certificate (preventing MITM attacks)

If a token is compromised, it can be rotated instantly with:
```
docker swarm join-token --rotate <worker|manager>

When a node joins the Swarm:

  - it connects to the current leader
  - it accepts connections from worker nodes

- if the node is a worker:

  - it connects to one of the managers (leader or follower)

- The *data plane* (communication between containers) is not encrypted by default

  (but this can be activated on a by-network basis, using IPSEC,
  leveraging hardware crypto if available)

## Adding more manager nodes

- Right now, we have only one manager (node1)

- If we lose it, we lose quorum - and that's *very bad!*

- Containers running on other nodes will be fine ...

- But we won't be able to get or set anything related to the cluster

- If the manager is permanently gone, we will have to do a manual repair!

- Nobody wants to do that ... so let's make our cluster highly available

the node you're talking to.

On non-manager nodes:
<br/>you will get an error message telling you that
the node is not a manager.

As we saw earlier, you can only control the Swarm through a manager node.

## How many managers do we need?

- 2N+1 nodes can (and will) tolerate N failures
  <br/>(you can have an even number of managers, but there is no point)

- 1 manager = no failure

- 5 managers = 2 failures (or 1 failure during 1 maintenance)

- 7 managers and more = now you might be overdoing it for most designs

## Why not have *all* nodes be managers?

- With Raft, writes have to go to (and be acknowledged by) all nodes

- Thus, it's harder to reach consensus in larger groups

- Only one manager is Leader (writable), so more managers ‚â† more capacity

- Managers should be &#60; 10ms latency from each other

- These design parameters lead us to recommended designs

.debug[[swarm/morenodes.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/morenodes.md)]
---

## What would McGyver do?

- Keep managers in one region (multi-zone/datacenter/rack)

- Groups of 3 or 5 nodes: all are managers. Beyond 5, separate out managers and workers

- Groups of 10-100 nodes: pick 5 "stable" nodes to be managers

- Groups of more than 100 nodes: watch your managers' CPU and RAM

  - 16GB memory or more, 4 CPU's or more, SSD's for Raft I/O
  - otherwise, break down your nodes in multiple smaller clusters

## What's the upper limit?

- We don't know!

- Internal testing at Docker Inc.: 1000-10000 nodes is fine

  - deployed to a single cloud region

  - one of the main take-aways was *"you're gonna need a bigger manager"*

- Testing by the community: [4700 heterogeneous nodes all over the 'net](https://sematext.com/blog/2016/11/14/docker-swarm-lessons-from-swarm3k/)

  - it just works, assuming they have the resources

  - more nodes require manager CPU and networking; more containers require RAM

  - scheduling of large jobs (70,000 containers) is slow, though ([getting better](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/37372)!)

  ```

]

## Checking service logs

(New in Docker Engine 17.05)

- Just like `docker logs` shows the output of a specific local container ...

- ... `docker service logs` shows the output of all the containers of a specific service

.exercise[

- Check the output of our ping command:
  ```bash
  docker service logs pingpong
  ```

]

Flags `--follow` and `--tail` are available, as well as a few others.

Note: by default, when a container is destroyed (e.g. when scaling down), its logs are lost.

.exercise[

- Look up the `NODE` on which the container is running:
  ```bash
  docker service ps pingpong
  ```

- If you use Play-With-Docker, switch to that node's tab, or set `DOCKER_HOST`

- Otherwise, `ssh` into that node or use `$(eval docker-machine env node...)`

  <!-- ```wait No such container: containerID``` -->

- Go back to `node1` afterwards

## Scale our service

- Services can be scaled in a pinch with the `docker service update` command

.exercise[

  ```bash
  docker service update pingpong --replicas 6
  ```

- Check that we have two containers on the current node:
  ```bash
  docker ps

## Monitoring deployment progress with `--detach`

(New in Docker Engine 17.10)

- The CLI monitors commands that create/update/delete services

- In effect, `--detach=false` is the default

  - synchronous operation
  - the CLI will monitor and display the progress of our request
  - it exits only when the operation is complete
  - Ctrl-C to detach at anytime

- `--detach=true`

  - asynchronous operation
  - the CLI just submits our request
  - it exits as soon as the request is committed into Raft

.debug[[swarm/firstservice.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/firstservice.md)]
---

## To `--detach` or not to `--detach`

- `--detach=false`

  - great when experimenting, to see what's going on

  - also great when orchestrating complex deployments
    <br/>(when you want to wait for a service to be ready before starting another)

- `--detach=true`

  - great for independent operations that can be parallelized

  - great in headless scripts (where nobody's watching anyway)

.warning[`--detach=true` does not complete *faster*. It just *doesn't wait* for completion.]

## `--detach` over time

- Docker Engine 17.10 and later: the default is `--detach=false`

- From Docker Engine 17.05 to 17.09: the default is `--detach=true`

- Prior to Docker 17.05: `--detach` doesn't exist

 (You can watch progress with e.g. `watch docker service ps <serviceID>`)

.debug[[swarm/firstservice.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/firstservice.md)]
---

## `--detach` in action

.exercise[

- Scale the service to ensure 3 copies per node:
  ```bash
  docker service update pingpong --replicas 9 --detach=false
  ```

- And then to 4 copies per node:
  ```bash
  docker service update pingpong --replicas 12 --detach=true
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/firstservice.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/firstservice.md)]
---

## Expose a service

- Services can be exposed, with two special properties:

  - the public port is available on *every node of the Swarm*,

  - requests coming on the public port are load balanced across all instances.

- This is achieved with option `-p/--publish`; as an approximation:

  `docker run -p ‚Üí docker service create -p`

- If you indicate a single port number, it will be mapped on a port
  starting at 30000
  <br/>(vs. 32768 for single container mapping)

- You can indicate two port numbers to set the public port number
  <br/>(just like with `docker run -p`)

  ```bash
  docker service create --name search --publish 9200:9200 --replicas 5 \
         elasticsearch`:2`
  ```

## Tasks lifecycle

- During the deployment, you will be able to see multiple states:

  - assigned (the task has been assigned to a specific node)

  - preparing (this mostly means "pulling the image")

  - starting

  - running

- When a task is terminated (stopped, killed...) it cannot be restarted

  (A replacement task will be created)

## Test our service

- We mapped port 9200 on the nodes, to port 9200 in the containers

- Let's try to reach that port!

.exercise[

<!-- Give it a few seconds to be ready ```bash sleep 5``` -->

- Try the following command:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:9200
  ```

]

(If you get `Connection refused`: congratulations, you are very fast indeed! Just try again.)

ElasticSearch serves a little JSON document with some basic information
about this instance; including a randomly-generated super-hero name.

.debug[[swarm/firstservice.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/firstservice.md)]
---

## Test the load balancing

- If we repeat our `curl` command multiple times, we will see different names

.exercise[

- Send 10 requests, and see which instances serve them:
  ```bash
    for N in $(seq 1 10); do
      curl -s localhost:9200 | jq .name
    done
  ```

]

Note: if you don't have `jq` on your Play-With-Docker instance, just install it:

apk add --no-cache jq
```

---

## Load balancing results

Traffic is handled by our clusters [routing mesh](
https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/ingress/).

Each request is served by one of the instances, in rotation.

Note: if you try to access the service from your browser,
you will probably see the same
instance name over and over, because your browser (unlike curl) will try
to re-use the same connection.

## Under the hood of the routing mesh

- Load balancing is done by IPVS

- IPVS is a high-performance, in-kernel load balancer

- It's been around for a long time (merged in the kernel since 2.4)

- Each node runs a local load balancer

  (Allowing connections to be routed directly to the destination,
  without extra hops)

## Managing inbound traffic

There are many ways to deal with inbound traffic on a Swarm cluster.

- Put all (or a subset) of your nodes in a DNS `A` record (good for web clients)

- Assign your nodes (or a subset) to an external load balancer (ELB, etc.)

- Use a virtual IP and make sure that it is assigned to an "alive" node

- etc.

## Managing HTTP traffic

- The TCP routing mesh doesn't parse HTTP headers

- If you want to place multiple HTTP services on port 80/443, you need something more

- You can set up NGINX or HAProxy on port 80/443 to route connections to the correct
  Service, but they need to be "Swarm aware" to dynamically update configs

--

- Docker EE provides its own [Layer 7 routing](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/interlock/)

  - Service labels like `com.docker.lb.hosts=<FQDN>` are detected automatically via Docker 
  API and dynamically update the configuration

--

- Two common open source options:

  - [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) - popular, many features, requires running on managers, 
  needs key/value for HA
  
  - [Docker Flow Proxy](http://proxy.dockerflow.com/) - uses HAProxy, made for 
  Swarm by Docker Captain [@vfarcic](https://twitter.com/vfarcic)

class: btw-labels

## You should use labels

- Labels are a great way to attach arbitrary information to services

- Examples:

  - HTTP vhost of a web app or web service

  - backup schedule for a stateful service

  - owner of a service (for billing, paging...)

  - correlate Swarm objects together (services, volumes, configs, secrets, etc.)

---

## Pro-tip for ingress traffic management

- It is possible to use *local* networks with Swarm services

- This means that you can do something like this:
  ```bash
  docker service create --network host --mode global traefik ...
  ```

  (This runs the `traefik` load balancer on each node of your cluster, in the `host` network)

- This gives you native performance (no iptables, no proxy, no nothing!)

- The load balancer will "see" the clients' IP addresses

- But: a container cannot simultaneously be in the `host` network and another network

  (You will have to route traffic to containers using exposed ports or UNIX sockets)

---

class: extra-details

## Using local networks (`host`, `macvlan` ...)

- It is possible to connect services to local networks

- Using the `host` network is fairly straightforward

  (With the caveats described on the previous slide)

- Other network drivers are a bit more complicated

  (IP allocation may have to be coordinated between nodes)

- See for instance [this guide](
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-macvlan/
  ) to get started on `macvlan`

- See [this PR](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/32981) for more information about local network drivers in Swarm mode

## Connect to the visualization webapp

- It runs a web server on port 8080

.exercise[

- Point your browser to port 8080 of your node1's public ip

  (If you use Play-With-Docker, click on the (8080) badge)

  <!-- ```open http://node1:8080``` -->

## Why This Is More Important Than You Think

- The visualizer accesses the Docker API *from within a container*

- This is a common pattern: run container management tools *in containers*

- Instead of viewing your cluster, this could take care of logging, metrics, autoscaling ...

- We can run it within a service, too! We won't do it yet, but the command would look like:

  ```bash
    docker service create \
      --mount source=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
      --name viz --constraint node.role==manager ...
  ```

[Francisco Miranda](https://github.com/maroshii).

[Mano Marks](https://twitter.com/manomarks) adapted
it to Swarm and maintains it.

---

## Terminate our services

- Before moving on, we will remove those services

- `docker service rm` can accept multiple services names or IDs

- `docker service ls` can accept the `-q` flag

- A Shell snippet a day keeps the cruft away

.exercise[

- Remove all services with this one liner:
  ```bash
  docker service ls -q | xargs docker service rm
  ```

# Our app on Swarm

In this part, we will:

- **build** images for our app,

- **ship** these images with a registry,

- **run** services using these images.

.debug[[swarm/ourapponswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/ourapponswarm.md)]
---

## Why do we need to ship our images?

- When we do `docker-compose up`, images are built for our services

- These images are present only on the local node

- We need these images to be distributed on the whole Swarm

- The easiest way to achieve that is to use a Docker registry

- Once our images are on a registry, we can reference them when
  creating our services

.debug[[swarm/ourapponswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/ourapponswarm.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Build, ship, and run, for a single service

If we had only one service (built from a `Dockerfile` in the
current directory), our workflow could look like this:

```
docker build -t jpetazzo/doublerainbow:v0.1 .
docker push jpetazzo/doublerainbow:v0.1
docker service create jpetazzo/doublerainbow:v0.1
```

We just have to adapt this to our application, which has 4 services!

.debug[[swarm/ourapponswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/ourapponswarm.md)]
---

## The plan

- Build on our local node (`node1`)

- Tag images so that they are named `localhost:5000/servicename`

- Upload them to a registry

- Create services using the images

.debug[[swarm/ourapponswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/ourapponswarm.md)]
---

## Which registry do we want to use?

.small[

- **Docker Hub**

  - hosted by Docker Inc.
  - requires an account (free, no credit card needed)
  - images will be public (unless you pay)
  - located in AWS EC2 us-east-1

- **Docker Trusted Registry**

  - self-hosted commercial product
  - requires a subscription (free 30-day trial available)
  - images can be public or private
  - located wherever you want

- **Docker open source registry**

  - self-hosted barebones repository hosting
  - doesn't require anything
  - doesn't come with anything either
  - located wherever you want

- **Lots of 3rd party cloud or self-hosted options**

  - AWS/Azure/Google Container Registry
  - GitLab, Quay, JFrog

## Using Docker Hub

*If we wanted to use the Docker Hub...*

- We would log into the Docker Hub:
  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

- And in the following slides, we would use our Docker Hub login
  (e.g. `jpetazzo`) instead of the registry address (i.e. `127.0.0.1:5000`)

## Using Docker Trusted Registry

*If we wanted to use DTR, we would...*

- Make sure we have a Docker Hub account

- [Activate a Docker EE subscription](

- Install DTR on our machines

- Use `dtraddress:port/user` instead of the registry address

# Swarm Stacks

- Compose is great for local development

- It can also be used to manage image lifecycle

  (i.e. build images and push them to a registry)

- Compose files *v2* are great for local development

- Compose files *v3* can also be used for production deployments!

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Compose file version 3

(New in Docker Engine 1.13)

- Almost identical to version 2

- Can be directly used by a Swarm cluster through `docker stack ...` commands

- Introduces a `deploy` section to pass Swarm-specific parameters

- Resource limits are moved to this `deploy` section

- See [here](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning.md#upgrading) for the complete list of changes

- Supersedes *Distributed Application Bundles*

  (JSON payload describing an application; could be generated from a Compose file)

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Our first stack

We need a registry to move images around.

Without a stack file, it would be deployed with the following command:

```bash
docker service create --publish 5000:5000 registry
```

Now, we are going to deploy it with the following stack file:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  registry:
    image: registry
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Checking our stack files

- All the stack files that we will use are in the `stacks` directory

.exercise[

- Go to the `stacks` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/stacks
  ```

- Check `registry.yml`:
  ```bash
  cat registry.yml
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Deploying our first stack

- All stack manipulation commands start with `docker stack`

- Under the hood, they map to `docker service` commands

- Stacks have a *name* (which also serves as a namespace)

- Stacks are specified with the aforementioned Compose file format version 3

.exercise[

- Deploy our local registry:
  ```bash
  docker stack deploy --compose-file registry.yml registry
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Inspecting stacks

- `docker stack ps` shows the detailed state of all services of a stack

.exercise[

- Check that our registry is running correctly:
  ```bash
  docker stack ps registry
  ```

- Confirm that we get the same output with the following command:
  ```bash
  docker service ps registry_registry
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

class: btp-manual

## Specifics of stack deployment

Our registry is not *exactly* identical to the one deployed with `docker service create`!

- Each stack gets its own overlay network

- Services of the stack are connected to this network
  <br/>(unless specified differently in the Compose file)

- Services get network aliases matching their name in the Compose file
  <br/>(just like when Compose brings up an app specified in a v2 file)

- Services are explicitly named `<stack_name>_<service_name>`

- Services and tasks also get an internal label indicating which stack they belong to

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

class: btp-auto

## Testing our local registry

- Connecting to port 5000 *on any node of the cluster* routes us to the registry

- Therefore, we can use `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` as our registry

.exercise[

- Issue the following API request to the registry:
  ```bash
  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/v2/_catalog
  ```

]

It should return:

```json
{"repositories":[]}
```

If that doesn't work, retry a few times; perhaps the container is still starting.

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

class: btp-auto

## Pushing an image to our local registry

- We can retag a small image, and push it to the registry

.exercise[

- Make sure we have the busybox image, and retag it:
  ```bash
  docker pull busybox
  docker tag busybox 127.0.0.1:5000/busybox
  ```

- Push it:
  ```bash
  docker push 127.0.0.1:5000/busybox
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

class: btp-auto

## Checking what's on our local registry

- The registry API has endpoints to query what's there

.exercise[

- Ensure that our busybox image is now in the local registry:
  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2/_catalog
  ```

]

The curl command should now output:
```json
"repositories":["busybox"]}
```

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Building and pushing stack services

- When using Compose file version 2 and above, you can specify *both* `build` and `image`

- When both keys are present:

  - Compose does "business as usual" (uses `build`)

  - but the resulting image is named as indicated by the `image` key
    <br/>
    (instead of `<projectname>_<servicename>:latest`)

  - it can be pushed to a registry with `docker-compose push`

- Example:

  ```yaml
    webfront:
      build: www
      image: myregistry.company.net:5000/webfront
  ```

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Using Compose to build and push images

.exercise[

- Try it:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  ```

]

Let's have a look at the `dockercoins.yml` file while this is building and pushing.

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  rng:
    build: dockercoins/rng
    image: ${REGISTRY-127.0.0.1:5000}/rng:${TAG-latest}
    deploy:
      mode: global
  ...
  redis:
    image: redis
  ...
  worker:
    build: dockercoins/worker
    image: ${REGISTRY-127.0.0.1:5000}/worker:${TAG-latest}
    ...
    deploy:
      replicas: 10
```

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Deploying the application

- Now that the images are on the registry, we can deploy our application stack

.exercise[

- Create the application stack:
  ```bash
  docker stack deploy --compose-file dockercoins.yml dockercoins
  ```

]

We can now connect to any of our nodes on port 8000, and we will see the familiar hashing speed graph.

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Maintaining multiple environments

There are many ways to handle variations between environments.

- Compose loads `docker-compose.yml` and (if it exists) `docker-compose.override.yml`

- Compose can load alternate file(s) by setting the `-f` flag or the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable

- Compose files can *extend* other Compose files, selectively including services:

  ```yaml
    web:
      extends:
        file: common-services.yml
        service: webapp
  ```

See [this documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) for more details about these techniques.

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Good to know ...

- Compose file version 3 adds the `deploy` section

- Further versions (3.1, ...) add more features (secrets, configs ...)

- You can re-run `docker stack deploy` to update a stack

- You can make manual changes with `docker service update` ...

- ... But they will be wiped out each time you `docker stack deploy`

  (That's the intended behavior, when one thinks about it!)

- `extends` doesn't work with `docker stack deploy`

  (But you can use `docker-compose config` to "flatten" your configuration)

.debug[[swarm/stacks.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/stacks.md)]
---

## Summary

- We've seen how to set up a Swarm

- We've used it to host our own registry

- We've built our app container images

- We've used the registry to host those images

- We've deployed and scaled our application

- We've seen how to use Compose to streamline deployments

- Awesome job, team!

# CI/CD for Docker and orchestration

A quick note about continuous integration and deployment

- This lab won't have you building out CI/CD pipelines

- We're cheating a bit by building images on server hosts and not in CI tool

- Docker and orchestration works with all the CI and deployment tools

.debug[[swarm/cicd.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/cicd.md)]
---

## CI/CD general process 

- Have your CI build your images, run tests *in them*, then push to registry

- If you security scan, do it then on your images after tests but before push

- Optionally, have CI do continuous deployment if build/test/push is successful

- CD tool would SSH into nodes, or use docker cli against remote engine

- If supported, it could use docker engine TCP API (swarm API is built-in)

# Updating services

- We want to make changes to the web UI

- The process is as follows:

  - edit code

  - build new image

  - ship new image

  - run new image

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]
---

## Updating a single service with `service update`

- To update a single service, we could do the following:
  ```bash
  export REGISTRY=127.0.0.1:5000
  export TAG=v0.2
  IMAGE=$REGISTRY/dockercoins_webui:$TAG
  docker build -t $IMAGE webui/
  docker push $IMAGE
  docker service update dockercoins_webui --image $IMAGE
  ```

- Make sure to tag properly your images: update the `TAG` at each iteration

  (When you check which images are running, you want these tags to be uniquely identifiable)

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]
---

## Updating services with `stack deploy`

- With the Compose integration, all we have to do is:
  ```bash
  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f composefile.yml build
  docker-compose -f composefile.yml push
  docker stack deploy -c composefile.yml nameofstack
  ```

--

- That's exactly what we used earlier to deploy the app

- We don't need to learn new commands!

- It will diff each service and only update ones that changed

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]
---

## Changing the code

- Let's make the numbers on the Y axis bigger!

.exercise[

- Update the size of text on our webui:
  ```bash
  sed -i "s/15px/50px/" dockercoins/webui/files/index.html
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]
---

## Build, ship, and run our changes

- Four steps:

  1. Set (and export!) the `TAG` environment variable
  2. `docker-compose build`
  3. `docker-compose push`
  4. `docker stack deploy`

.exercise[

- Build, ship, and run:
  ```bash
  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  docker stack deploy -c dockercoins.yml dockercoins
  ```

]

- Because we're tagging all images in this demo v0.2, deploy will update all apps, FYI

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]
---

## Viewing our changes

- Wait at least 10 seconds (for the new version to be deployed)

- Then reload the web UI

- Or just mash "reload" frantically

- ... Eventually the legend on the left will be bigger!

.debug[[swarm/updatingservices.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/updatingservices.md)]

## Before we continue ...

The following exercises assume that you have a 5-nodes Swarm cluster.

If you come here from a previous tutorial and still have your cluster: great!

Otherwise: check [part 1](#part-1) to learn how to set up your own cluster.

We pick up exactly where we left you, so we assume that you have:

- a Swarm cluster with at least 3 nodes,

- a self-hosted registry,

- DockerCoins up and running.

The next slide has a cheat sheet if you need to set that up in a pinch.

.debug[[swarm/operatingswarm.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/operatingswarm.md)]
---

class: self-paced

## Catching up

Assuming you have 5 nodes provided by
[Play-With-Docker](https://www.play-with-docker/), do this from `node1`:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0
TOKEN=$(docker swarm join-token -q manager)
for N in $(seq 2 5); do
  DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:2375 docker swarm join --token $TOKEN node1:2377
done
git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
cd container.training/stacks
docker stack deploy --compose-file registry.yml registry
docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
docker stack deploy --compose-file dockercoins.yml dockercoins
```

You should now be able to connect to port 8000 and see the DockerCoins web UI.

- Encryption at rest = protect against storage theft or prying

- Remember:

  - control plane is authenticated through mutual TLS, certs rotated every 90 days

  - control plane is encrypted with AES-GCM, keys rotated every 12 hours

  - data plane is not encrypted by default (for performance reasons),

# Least privilege model

- All the important data is stored in the "Raft log"

- Managers nodes have read/write access to this data

- Workers nodes have no access to this data

- Workers only receive the minimum amount of data that they need:

  - which services to run
  - network configuration information for these services
  - credentials for these services

- Compromising a worker node does not give access to the full cluster

.debug[[swarm/leastprivilege.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/leastprivilege.md)]
---

## What can I do if I compromise a worker node?

- I can enter the containers running on that node

- I can access the configuration and credentials used by these containers

- I can inspect the network traffic of these containers

- I cannot inspect or disrupt the network traffic of other containers

  (network information is provided by manager nodes; ARP spoofing is not possible)

- I cannot infer the topology of the cluster and its number of nodes

- I can only learn the IP addresses of the manager nodes

## Guidelines for workload isolation

- Define security levels

- Define security zones

- Put managers in the highest security zone

- Enforce workloads of a given security level to run in a given zone

- Enforcement can be done with [Authorization Plugins](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/)

## A reminder about *scope*

- Out of the box, Docker API access is "all or nothing"

- When someone has access to the Docker API, they can access *everything*

- If your developers are using the Docker API to deploy on the dev cluster ...

  ... and the dev cluster is the same as the prod cluster ...

  ... it means that your devs have access to your production data, passwords, etc.

- This can easily be avoided

.debug[[swarm/apiscope.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/apiscope.md)]
---

## Fine-grained API access control

A few solutions, by increasing order of flexibility:

- Use separate clusters for different security perimeters

  (And different credentials for each cluster)

--

- Add an extra layer of abstraction (sudo scripts, hooks, or full-blown PAAS)

--

- Enable [authorization plugins]

  - each API request is vetted by your plugin(s)

  - by default, the *subject name* in the client TLS certificate is used as user name

  - example: [user and permission management] in [UCP]

[authorization plugins]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/
[UCP]: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/
[user and permission management]: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/admin/manage-users/

# Setting up ELK to store container logs

*Important foreword: this is not an "official" or "recommended"
setup; it is just an example. We used ELK in this demo because
it's a popular setup and we keep being asked about it; but you
will have equal success with Fluent or other logging stacks!*

What we will do:

- Spin up an ELK stack with services

- Gaze at the spiffy Kibana web UI

- Manually send a few log entries using one-shot containers

- Set our containers up to send their logs to Logstash

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## What's in an ELK stack?

- ELK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Logstash (to receive log entries from various
    sources, process them, and forward them to various
    destinations)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we will configure is Logstash

- We will accept log entries using the GELF protocol

- Log entries will be stored in ElasticSearch,
  <br/>and displayed on Logstash's stdout for debugging

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-manual

## Setting up ELK

- We need three containers: ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana

- We will place them on a common network, `logging`

.exercise[

- Create the network:
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver overlay logging
  ```

- Create the ElasticSearch service:
  ```bash
  docker service create --network logging --name elasticsearch elasticsearch:2.4
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-manual

## Setting up Kibana

- Kibana exposes the web UI

- Its default port (5601) needs to be published

- It needs a tiny bit of configuration: the address of the ElasticSearch service

- We don't want Kibana logs to show up in Kibana (it would create clutter)
  <br/>so we tell Logspout to ignore them

.exercise[

- Create the Kibana service:
  ```bash
  docker service create --network logging --name kibana --publish 5601:5601 \
         -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200 kibana:4.6
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-manual

## Setting up Logstash

- Logstash needs some configuration to listen to GELF messages and send them to ElasticSearch

- We could author a custom image bundling this configuration

- We can also pass the [configuration](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/elk/logstash.conf) on the command line

.exercise[

- Create the Logstash service:
  ```bash
    docker service create --network logging --name logstash -p 12201:12201/udp \
           logstash:2.4 -e "$(cat ~/container.training/elk/logstash.conf)"
  ```

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-manual

## Checking Logstash

- Before proceeding, let's make sure that Logstash started properly

.exercise[

- Lookup the node running the Logstash container:
  ```bash
  docker service ps logstash
  ```

- Connect to that node

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-manual

## View Logstash logs

.exercise[

- View the logs of the logstash service:
  ```bash
  docker service logs logstash --follow
  ```

  <!-- ```wait "message" => "ok"``` -->
  <!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

]

You should see the heartbeat messages:
.small[
```json
{      "message" => "ok",
          "host" => "1a4cfb063d13",
      "@version" => "1",
    "@timestamp" => "2016-06-19T00:45:45.273Z"
}
```
]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-auto

## Deploying our ELK cluster

- We will use a stack file

.exercise[

- Build, ship, and run our ELK stack:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f elk.yml build
  docker-compose -f elk.yml push
  docker stack deploy -c elk.yml elk
  ```

]

Note: the *build* and *push* steps are not strictly necessary, but they don't hurt!

Let's have a look at the [Compose file](
https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/stacks/elk.yml).

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

class: elk-auto

## Checking that our ELK stack works correctly

- Let's view the logs of logstash

  (Who logs the loggers?)

.exercise[

- Stream logstash's logs:
  ```bash
  docker service logs --follow --tail 1 elk_logstash
  ```

]

You should see the heartbeat messages:

.small[
```json
{      "message" => "ok",
          "host" => "1a4cfb063d13",
      "@version" => "1",
    "@timestamp" => "2016-06-19T00:45:45.273Z"
}
```
]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Testing the GELF receiver

- In a new window, we will generate a logging message

- We will use a one-off container, and Docker's GELF logging driver

.exercise[

- Send a test message:
  ```bash
    docker run --log-driver gelf --log-opt gelf-address=udp://127.0.0.1:12201 \
           --rm alpine echo hello
  ```
]

The test message should show up in the logstash container logs.

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Sending logs from a service

- We were sending from a "classic" container so far; let's send logs from a service instead

- We're lucky: the parameters (`--log-driver` and `--log-opt`) are exactly the same!


.exercise[

- Send a test message:
  ```bash
    docker service create \
           --log-driver gelf --log-opt gelf-address=udp://127.0.0.1:12201 \
           alpine echo hello
  ```

  <!-- ```wait Detected task failure``` -->
  <!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

]

The test message should show up as well in the logstash container logs.

--

In fact, *multiple messages will show up, and continue to show up every few seconds!*

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Restart conditions

- By default, if a container exits (or is killed with `docker kill`, or runs out of memory ...),
  the Swarm will restart it (possibly on a different machine)

- This behavior can be changed by setting the *restart condition* parameter

.exercise[

- Change the restart condition so that Swarm doesn't try to restart our container forever:
  ```bash
  docker service update `xxx` --restart-condition none
  ```
]

Available restart conditions are `none`, `any`, and `on-error`.

You can also set `--restart-delay`, `--restart-max-attempts`, and `--restart-window`.

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Connect to Kibana

- The Kibana web UI is exposed on cluster port 5601

.exercise[

- Connect to port 5601 of your cluster

  - if you're using Play-With-Docker, click on the (5601) badge above the terminal

  - otherwise, open http://(any-node-address):5601/ with your browser

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## "Configuring" Kibana

- If you see a status page with a yellow item, wait a minute and reload
  (Kibana is probably still initializing)

- Kibana should offer you to "Configure an index pattern":
  <br/>in the "Time-field name" drop down, select "@timestamp", and hit the
  "Create" button

- Then:

  - click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)
  - click "Last 15 minutes" (in the top-right corner)
  - click "Last 1 hour" (in the list in the middle)
  - click "Auto-refresh" (top-right corner)
  - click "5 seconds" (top-left of the list)

- You should see a series of green bars (with one new green bar every minute)

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Updating our services to use GELF

- We will now inform our Swarm to add GELF logging to all our services

- This is done with the `docker service update` command

- The logging flags are the same as before

.exercise[

- Enable GELF logging for the `rng` service:
  ```bash
    docker service update dockercoins_rng \
           --log-driver gelf --log-opt gelf-address=udp://127.0.0.1:12201
  ```

]

After ~15 seconds, you should see the log messages in Kibana.

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Viewing container logs

- Go back to Kibana

- Container logs should be showing up!

- We can customize the web UI to be more readable

.exercise[

- In the left column, move the mouse over the following
  columns, and click the "Add" button that appears:

  - host
  - container_name
  - message

<!--
  - logsource
  - program
  - message
-->

]

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## .warning[Don't update stateful services!]

- What would have happened if we had updated the Redis service?

- When a service changes, SwarmKit replaces existing container with new ones

- This is fine for stateless services

- But if you update a stateful service, its data will be lost in the process

- If we updated our Redis service, all our DockerCoins would be lost

.debug[[swarm/logging.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/logging.md)]
---

## Important afterword

**This is not a "production-grade" setup.**

It is just an educational example. We did set up a single
ElasticSearch instance and a single Logstash instance.

In a production setup, you need an ElasticSearch cluster
(both for capacity and availability reasons). You also
need multiple Logstash instances.

And if you want to withstand
bursts of logs, you need some kind of message queue:
Redis if you're cheap, Kafka if you want to make sure
that you don't drop messages on the floor. Good luck.

If you want to learn more about the GELF driver,
have a look at [this blog post](
https://jpetazzo.github.io/2017/01/20/docker-logging-gelf/).

# Metrics collection

- We want to gather metrics in a central place

- We will gather node metrics and container metrics

- We want a nice interface to view them (graphs)

.debug[[swarm/metrics.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/metrics.md)]
---

## Node metrics

- CPU, RAM, disk usage on the whole node

- Total number of processes running, and their states

- Number of open files, sockets, and their states

- I/O activity (disk, network), per operation or volume

- Physical/hardware (when applicable): temperature, fan speed ...

- ... and much more!

.debug[[swarm/metrics.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/metrics.md)]
---

## Container metrics

- Similar to node metrics, but not totally identical

- RAM breakdown will be different

  - active vs inactive memory
  - some memory is *shared* between containers, and accounted specially

- I/O activity is also harder to track

  - async writes can cause deferred "charges"
  - some page-ins are also shared between containers

For details about container metrics, see:
<br/>

## Application metrics

- Arbitrary metrics related to your application and business

- System performance: request latency, error rate ...

- Volume information: number of rows in database, message queue size ...

- Business data: inventory, items sold, revenue ...

## Tools

We will build *two* different metrics pipelines:

- One based on Intel Snap,

- Another based on Prometheus.

If you're using Play-With-Docker, skip the exercises
relevant to Intel Snap (we rely on a SSH server to deploy,
and PWD doesn't have that yet).

  Collects, processes, and publishes metrics

- InfluxDB

  Stores metrics

- Grafana

  Displays metrics visually

## Snap

- [github.com/intelsdi-x/snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap)

- Can collect, process, and publish metric data

- Doesn‚Äôt store metrics

- Works as a daemon (snapd) controlled by a CLI (snapctl)

- Offloads collecting, processing, and publishing to plugins

- Does nothing out of the box; configuration required!

- Docs: https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/

## InfluxDB

- Snap doesn't store metrics data

- InfluxDB is specifically designed for time-series data

  - CRud vs. CRUD (you rarely if ever update/delete data)

  - orthogonal read and write patterns

  - storage format optimization is key (for disk usage and performance)

- Snap has a plugin allowing to *publish* to InfluxDB

## Getting and setting up Snap

- We will install Snap directly on the nodes

- Release tarballs are available from GitHub

- We will use a *global service*
  <br/>(started on all nodes, including nodes added later)

- This service will download and unpack Snap in /opt and /usr/local

- /opt and /usr/local will be bind-mounted from the host

- This service will effectively install Snap on the hosts

## Actually collecting metrics: introducing *tasks*

- To start collecting/processing/publishing metric data, you need to create a *task*

- A *task* indicates:

  - *what* to collect (which metrics)
  - *when* to collect it (e.g. how often)
  - *how* to process it (e.g. use it directly, or compute moving averages)
  - *where* to publish it

- Tasks can be defined with manifests written in JSON or YAML

- Some plugins, such as the Docker collector, allow for wildcards (\*) in the metrics "path"
  <br/>(see snap/docker-influxdb.json)

- More resources:
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TASKS.md

## Snap Tribe Mode

- Tribe is Snap's clustering mechanism

- When tribe mode is enabled, nodes can join *agreements*

- When a node in an *agreement* does something (e.g. load a plugin or run a task),
  <br/>other nodes of that agreement do the same thing

- We will use it to load the Docker collector and InfluxDB publisher on all nodes,
  <br/>and run a task to use them

- Without tribe mode, we would have to load plugins and run tasks manually on every node

- More resources:

## Running InfluxDB

- We will create a service for InfluxDB

- We will use the official image

- InfluxDB uses multiple ports:

  - 8086 (HTTP API; we need this)

  - 8083 (admin interface; we need this)

  - 8088 (cluster communication; not needed here)

  - more ports for other protocols (graphite, collectd...)

- We will just publish the first two

.debug[[swarm/metrics.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/metrics.md)]

## Creating the InfluxDB service

.exercise[

- Start an InfluxDB service, publishing ports 8083 and 8086:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name influxdb \
           --publish 8083:8083 \
           --publish 8086:8086 \
           influxdb:0.13
  ```

]

Note: this will allow any node to publish metrics data to `localhost:8086`,
and it will allow us to access the admin interface by connecting to any node
on port 8083.

.warning[Make sure to use InfluxDB 0.13; a few things changed in 1.0
(like, the name of the default retention policy is now "autogen") and
this breaks a few things.]

- In the top-right corner, select "Database: snap"

]

Note: the InfluxDB query language *looks like* SQL but it's not.

## Setting a retention policy

- When graduating to 1.0, InfluxDB changed the name of the default policy

- It used to be "default" and it is now "autogen"

- Snap still uses "default" and this results in errors

  ```
  CREATE RETENTION POLICY "default" ON "snap" DURATION 1w REPLICATION 1

  nodes in the agreement will also load these plugins

  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-collector-docker

## Start a simple collection task

- Again, we will create a task on the local node

- The task will be replicated on other nodes members of the same agreement

.exercise[

- Load a task manifest file collecting a couple of metrics on all containers,
  <br/>and sending them to InfluxDB:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/snap
  snapctl task create -t docker-influxdb.json
  ```

]

Note: the task description sends metrics to the InfluxDB API endpoint
located at 127.0.0.1:8086. Since the InfluxDB container is published
on port 8086, 127.0.0.1:8086 always routes traffic to the InfluxDB
container.

## If things go wrong...

Note: if a task runs into a problem (e.g. it's trying to publish
to a metrics database, but the database is unreachable), the task
will be stopped.

You will have to restart it manually by running:

```bash
snapctl task enable <ID>
snapctl task start <ID>
```

This must be done *per node*. Alternatively, you can delete+re-create
the task (it will delete+re-create on all nodes).

## Prometheus components

- The *Prometheus server* pulls, stores, and displays metrics

- Its configuration defines a list of *exporter* endpoints
  <br/>(that list can be dynamic, using e.g. Consul, DNS, Etcd...)

- The exporters expose metrics over HTTP using a simple line-oriented format

  (An optimized format using protobuf is also possible)

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics

- Prometheus itself exposes its own internal metrics, too:

- A *Prometheus server* will *scrape* URLs like these

  (It can also use protobuf to avoid the overhead of parsing line-oriented formats!)

## Injecting a configuration file

(New in Docker Engine 17.06)

- We are creating a custom image *just to inject a configuration*

- Instead, we could use the base Prometheus image + a `config` 

- A `config` is a blob (usually, a configuration file) that:

  - is created and managed through the Docker API (and CLI)

  - gets persisted into the Raft log (i.e. safely)

  - can be associated to a service
    <br/>
    (this injects the blob as a plain file in the service's containers)

## Differences between `config` and `secret`

The two are very similar, but ...

- `configs`:

  - can be injected to any filesystem location

  - can be viewed and extracted using the Docker API or CLI

- `secrets`:

  - can only be injected into `/run/secrets`

  - are never stored in clear text on disk

  - cannot be viewed or extracted with the Docker API or CLI

## Specifying a `config` in a Compose file

- In each service, an optional `configs` section can list as many configs as you want

- Each config can specify:

  - an optional `target` (path to inject the configuration; by default: root of the container)

  - ownership and permissions (by default, the file will be owned by UID 0, i.e. `root`)

- These configs reference top-level `configs` elements

- The top-level configs can be declared as:

  - *external*, meaning that it is supposed to be created before you deploy the stack

  - referencing a file, whose content is used to initialize the config

## Building the query from scratch

- We are going to build the same query from scratch

- This doesn't intend to be a detailed PromQL course

- This is merely so that you (I) can pretend to know how the previous query works
  <br/>so that your coworkers (you) can be suitably impressed (or not)

  (Or, so that we can build other queries if necessary, or adapt if cAdvisor,
  Prometheus, or anything else changes and requires editing the query!)

## Displaying a raw metric for *all* containers

- Click on the "Graph" tab on top

  *This takes us to a blank dashboard*

- Click on the "Insert metric at cursor" drop down, and select `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`

  *This puts the metric name in the query box*

- Click on "Execute"

  *This fills a table of measurements below*

- Click on "Graph" (next to "Console")

  *This replaces the table of measurements with a series of graphs (after a few seconds)*

## Selecting metrics for a specific service

- Hover over the lines in the graph

  (Look for the ones that have labels like `container_label_com_docker_...`)

- Edit the query, adding a condition between curly braces:

  .small[`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="dockercoins_worker"}`]

- Click on "Execute"

  *Now we should see one line per CPU per container*

- If you want to select by container ID, you can use a regex match: `id=~"/docker/c4bf.*"`

- You can also specify multiple conditions by separating them with commas

## Turn counters into rates

- What we see is the total amount of CPU used (in seconds)

- We want to see a *rate* (CPU time used / real time)

- To get a moving average over 1 minute periods, enclose the current expression within:

  ```
  rate ( ... { ... } [1m] )
  ```

  *This should turn our steadily-increasing CPU counter into a wavy graph*

- To get an instantaneous rate, use `irate` instead of `rate`

  (The time window is then used to limit how far behind to look for data if data points
  are missing in case of scrape failure; see [here](https://www.robustperception.io/irate-graphs-are-better-graphs/) for more details!)

  *This should show spikes that were previously invisible because they were smoothed out*

## Aggregate multiple data series

- We have one graph per CPU per container; we want to sum them

- Enclose the whole expression within:

  ```
  sum ( ... )
  ```

  *We now see a single graph*

.debug[[swarm/metrics.md](https://github.com/paulczar/container.training.git/tree/pks/slides/swarm/metrics.md)]
---

class: prom

## Collapse dimensions

- If we have multiple containers we can also collapse just the CPU dimension:

  ```
  sum without (cpu) ( ... )
  ```

  *This shows the same graph, but preserves the other labels*

- Congratulations, you wrote your first PromQL expression from scratch!

  [Julius Volz](https://twitter.com/juliusvolz) for their help with Prometheus!)

## Comparing Snap and Prometheus data

- If you haven't set up Snap, InfluxDB, and Grafana, skip this section

- If you have closed the Grafana tab, you might have to re-set up a new dashboard

  (Unless you saved it before navigating it away)

- To re-do the setup, just follow again the instructions from the previous chapter

## Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

.exercise[

- In a new tab, connect to Grafana (port 3000)

- Click on the Grafana logo (the orange spiral in the top-left corner)

- Click on "Data Sources"

- Click on the green "Add data source" button

]

We see the same input form that we filled earlier to connect to InfluxDB.

## Connecting to Prometheus from Grafana

.exercise[

- Enter "prom" in the name field

- Select "Prometheus" as the source type

- Enter http://(IP.address.of.any.node):9090 in the Url field

- Select "direct" as the access method

- Click on "Save and test"

]

Again, we should see a green box telling us "Data source is working."

Otherwise, double-check every field and try again!

## Adding the Prometheus data to our dashboard

.exercise[

- Go back to the the tab where we had our first Grafana dashboard

- Click on the blue "Add row" button in the lower right corner

- Click on the green tab on the left; select "Add panel" and "Graph"

]

This takes us to the graph editor that we used earlier.

## Querying Prometheus data from Grafana

The editor is a bit less friendly than the one we used for InfluxDB.

.exercise[

- Select "prom" as Panel data source

- Paste the query in the query field:
  ```
    sum without (cpu, id) ( irate (
      container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
        container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="influxdb"}[1m] ) )
  ```

- Click outside of the query field to confirm

- Close the row editor by clicking the "X" in the top right area

]

## Interpreting results

- The two graphs *should* be similar

- Protip: align the time references!

.exercise[

- Click on the clock in the top right corner

- Select "last 30 minutes"

- Click on "Zoom out"

- Now press the right arrow key (hold it down and watch the CPU usage increase!)

]

*Adjusting units is left as an exercise for the reader.*
